<h2>A FOREWORD BY MEG.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the good old times, when "Little Women"
worked and played together, the big garret
was the scene of many dramatic revels. After
a long day of teaching, sewing, and "helping
mother," the greatest delight of the girls was
to transform themselves into queens, knights,
and cavaliers of high degree, and ascend into a
world of fancy and romance. Cinderella's godmother
waved her wand, and the dismal room
became a fairy-land. Flowers bloomed, forests
arose, music sounded, and lovers exchanged
their vows by moonlight. Nothing was too
ambitious to attempt; armor, gondolas, harps,
towers, and palaces grew as if by magic, and
wonderful scenes of valor and devotion were
enacted before admiring audiences.</p>

<p>Jo, of course, played the villains, ghosts,
bandits, and disdainful queens; for her tragedy-loving
soul delighted in the lurid parts, and no
drama was perfect in her eyes without a touch
of the demonic or supernatural. Meg loved the
sentimental r√¥les, the tender maiden with the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
airy robes and flowing locks, who made impossible
sacrifices for ideal lovers, or the cavalier,
singing soft serenades and performing lofty acts
of gallantry and prowess. Amy was the fairy
sprite, while Beth enacted the page or messenger
when the scene required their aid.</p>

<p>But the most surprising part of the performance
was the length of the cast and the size
of the company; for Jo and Meg usually acted
the whole play, each often assuming five or six
characters, and with rapid change of dress becoming,
in one scene, a witch, a soldier, a beauteous
lady, and a haughty noble. This peculiar
arrangement accounts for many queer devices,
and the somewhat singular fact that each scene
offers but two actors, who vanish and reappear
at most inopportune moments, and in a great
variety of costume. Long speeches were introduced
to allow a ruffian to become a priest, or
a lovely damsel to disguise herself in the garb
of a sorceress; while great skill was required to
preserve the illusion, and astonish the audience
by these wonderful transformations.</p>

<p>The young amateur of to-day, who can easily
call to her aid all the arts of the costumer
and scene-maker, will find it hard to understand
the difficulties of this little company; for not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
only did they compose their plays, but they
were also their own carpenters, scene-painters,
property-men, dress-makers, and managers. In
place of a well-appointed stage, with the brilliant
lights and inspiring accessories of a mimic
theatre, the "Little Women" had a gloomy
garret or empty barn, and were obliged to
exercise all their ingenuity to present the scenes
of their ambitious dramas.</p>

<p>But it is surprising what fine effects can be
produced with old sheets, bright draperies, and
a judicious arrangement of lights, garlands, and
picturesque properties; and Jo's dramatic taste
made her an admirable stage-manager. Meg
was especially handy with saw and hammer, and
acted as stage-carpenter,&mdash;building balconies,
thrones, boats, and towers after peculiar designs
of her own. Bureaus, tables, and chairs,
piled aloft and arched with dark shawls, made
dungeon walls and witch's cave, or formed a
background for haunted forest and lonely glen.
Screens of white cloth furnished canvas on
which little Amy's skilful hand depicted palace
halls, or romantic scene for lovers' tryst; and
Beth's deft fingers were most apt in constructing
properties for stage adornment, and
transforming the frailest material into dazzling
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
raiment. For the costumes were a serious consideration.
No money could be spared from the
slender purse to supply the wardrobes of these
aspiring actors, and many were the devices to
clothe the little company.</p>

<p>Thus a robe in one scene became a cloak
in the next, and the drapery of a couch in the
third; while a bit of lace served as mantle, veil,
or turban, as best suited the turn of the play.
Hats covered with old velvet, and adorned with
feathers plucked from the duster, made most
effective headgear for gay cavalier or tragic
villain. From colored cotton were manufactured
fine Greek tunics and flowing trains; and
remarkable court costumes were evolved from
an old sofa-covering, which had seen better days,
and boasted a little gold thread and embroidery.</p>

<p>Stars of tin, sewed upon dark cambric, made
a suit of shining armor. Sandals were cut from
old boots. Strips of wood and silver paper were
fashioned into daggers, swords, and spears,
while from cardboard were created helmets,
harps, guitars, and antique lamps, that were
considered masterpieces of stage art.</p>

<p>Everything available was pressed into service;
colored paper, odds and ends of ribbon, even
tin cans and their bright wrappings were treasures
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
to the young actors, and all reappeared as
splendid properties.</p>

<p>At first a store of red curtains, some faded
brocades, and ancient shawls comprised the
stage wardrobe; but as the fame of the performances
spread abroad, contributions were made
to the little stock, and the girls became the
proud possessors of a velvet robe, a plumed hat
adorned with silver, long yellow boots, and a
quantity of mock pearls and tinsel ornaments.</p>

<p>Such wealth determined them to write a play
which should surpass all former efforts, give Jo
a chance to stalk haughtily upon the stage in
the magnificent boots, and Meg to appear in
gorgeous train and diadem of jewels.</p>

<p>"The Witch's Curse" was the result, and it
was produced with astounding effect, quite paralyzing
the audience by its splendid gloom.
Jo called it the "lurid drama," and always
considered it her masterpiece. But it cost
hours of thought and labor; for to construct a
dungeon, a haunted chamber, a cavern, and a
lonely forest taxed to the uttermost the ingenuity
of the actors. To introduce into one short
scene a bandit, two cavaliers, a witch, and a
fairy spirit&mdash;all enacted by two people&mdash;required
some skill, and lightning change of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
costume. To call up the ghostly visions and
mysterious voices which should appall the guilty
Count Rodolpho, was a task of no small difficulty.
But inspired by the desire to outshine themselves,
the children accomplished a play full
of revenge, jealousy, murder, and sorcery, of
all which indeed they knew nothing but the
name.</p>

<p>Hitherto their dramas had been of the most
sentimental description, given to the portrayal
of woman's devotion, filial affection, heroism,
and self-sacrifice. Indeed, these "Comic Tragedies"
with their highflown romance and fantastic
ideas of love and honor, are most characteristic
of the young girls whose lives were singularly
free from the experiences of many maidens of
their age.</p>

<p>Of the world they knew nothing; lovers
were ideal beings, clothed with all the beauty
of their innocent imaginations. Love was a
blissful dream; constancy, truth, courage, and
virtue quite every-day affairs of life. Their few
novels furnished the romantic element; the
favorite fairy-tales gave them material for the
supernatural; and their strong dramatic taste
enabled them to infuse both fire and pathos into
their absurd situations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
Jo revelled in catastrophe, and the darker
scenes were her delight; but she usually required
Meg to "do the love-part," which she
considered quite beneath her pen. Thus their
productions were a queer mixture of sentiment
and adventure, with entire disregard of such
matters as grammar, history, and geography,&mdash;all
of which were deemed of no importance by
these aspiring dramatists.</p>

<p>From the little stage library, still extant, the
following plays have been selected as fair examples
of the work of these children of sixteen
and seventeen. With some slight changes and
omissions, they remain as written more than
forty years ago by Meg and Jo, so dear to the
hearts of many other "Little Women."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theresa.</span> I cannot pray; my aching
heart finds rest alone in tears. Ah, what
a wretched fate is mine! Forced by a
father's will to wed a stranger ere I learned
to love, one short year hath taught me
what a bitter thing it is to wear a chain
that binds me unto one who hath proved
himself both jealous and unkind. The
fair hopes I once cherished are now gone,
and here a captive in my splendid home
I dwell forsaken, sorrowing and alone
[<i>weeps</i>]. [<i>Three taps upon the wall are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>

Why art thou here? Some danger must
have brought thee; tell me, dear brother.
Let me serve thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Sister dearest, thy kindly offered
aid is useless now. Thou canst not
help me; and I must add another sorrow
to the many that are thine. I came to
say farewell, Theresa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theresa.</span> Farewell! Oh, brother, do
not leave me! Thy love is all now left to
cheer my lonely life. Wherefore must
thou go? Tell me, I beseech thee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Forgive me if I grieve thee.
I will tell thee all. Thy husband hates
me, for I charged him with neglect and
cruelty to thee; and he hath vowed revenge
for my bold words. He hath whispered
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
false tales to the king, he hath
blighted all my hopes of rank and honor.
I am banished from the land, and must
leave thee and Leonore, and wander forth
an outcast and alone. But&mdash;let him beware!&mdash;I
shall return to take a deep
revenge for thy wrongs and my own.
Nay, sister, grieve not thus. I have
sworn to free thee from his power, and I
will keep my vow. Hope on and bear a little
longer, dear Theresa, and ere long I will
bear thee to a happy home [<i>noise is heard
without</i>]. Ha! what is that? Who comes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theresa.</span> 'Tis my lord returning from
the court. Fly, Louis, fly! Thou art
lost if he discover thee. Heaven bless
and watch above thee. Remember poor
Theresa, and farewell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> One last word of Leonore. I
have never told my love, yet she hath
smiled on me, and I should have won her
hand. Ah, tell her this, and bid her to be
true to him who in his exile will hope on,
and yet return to claim the heart he hath
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
loved so faithfully. Farewell, my sister.
Despair not,&mdash;I shall return.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Louis</span> <i>through the secret panel; drops his dagger.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theresa.</span> Thank Heaven, he is safe!&mdash;but

is hard to bear. Poor Louis, parted from
Leonore, his fair hopes blighted, all by thy

am weary of the world. Its gayeties but
make my heart more sad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Nay, then I will take thee to
the court, and there thou <i>must</i> be gay.
But I am weary; bring me wine, and

Ha! what is that? 'Tis none of mine.

<p><span class="smcap">Theresa.</span> I cannot. I must not, dare
not tell thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Darest thou refuse to answer?
Speak! Who hath dared to venture
hither? Is it thy brother? As thou
lovest life, I bid thee speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theresa.</span> I am innocent, and will not
betray the only one now left me on the
earth to love. Oh, pardon me, my lord;
I will obey in all but this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Thou <i>shalt</i> obey. I'll take thy
life but I will know. Thy brother must
be near,&mdash;this dagger was not here an
hour ago. Thy terror hath betrayed him.
I leave thee now to bid them search the
castle. But if I find him not, I shall
return; and if thou wilt not then confess,
I'll find a way to make thee. Remember,

thee dumb forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theresa.</span> No, no! I will not betray.

sad heart can ache no more. Rest to thy
soul, sweet lady. But for <i>thee</i>, thou cruel
villain, I have in store a deep revenge for
all thy sinful deeds. If there be power in
spell or charm, I'll conjure fearful dreams
upon thy head. I'll follow thee wherever
thou mayst go, and haunt thy sleep with
evil visions. I'll whisper strange words
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
that shall appall thee; dark phantoms shall
rise up before thee, and wild voices ringing
in thine ear shall tell thee of thy sins.
By all these will I make life like a hideous

a vengeful ghost I will haunt thee to thy
grave, and so revenge thy wrongs, poor,
murdered lady. Beware, Rodolpho! Old

<h3>NOTE TO SCENE SECOND.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mysterious cave was formed of old furniture,
covered with dark draperies, an opening
being left at the back wherein the spirits called
up by Norna might appear. A kitchen kettle
filled with steaming water made an effective
caldron over which the sorceress should murmur
her incantations; flaming pine-knots cast a
lurid glare over the scene; and large boughs,
artfully arranged about the stage, gave it the
appearance of a "gloomy wood."</p>

<p>When Louis "retires within," he at once
arrays himself in the white robes of the vision,
and awaits the witch's call to rise behind the
aperture in true dramatic style. He vanishes,

<div class="blockquot">[<i>A wood.</i> <span class="smcap">Norna's</span> <i>cave among the rocks.</i>
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Louis</span> <i>masked.</i>]</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Yes; 'tis the spot. How dark
and still! She is not here. Ho, Norna,
mighty sorceress! I seek thy aid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna</span> [<i>rising from the cave</i>]. I am here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> I seek thee, Norna, to learn
tidings of one most dear to me. Dost
thou know aught of Count Rodolpho's
wife? A strange tale hath reached me
that not many nights ago she disappeared,
and none know whither she hath gone.
Oh, tell me, is this true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> It is most true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> And canst thou tell me whither
she hath gone? I will reward thee well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> I can. She lies within her
tomb, in the chapel of the castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Dead!&mdash;it cannot be! They
told me she had fled away with some
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
young lord who had won her love. Was
it not true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> It is false as the villain's heart
who framed the tale. <i>I</i> bore the murdered
lady to her tomb, and laid her
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Murdered? How? When? By
whom? Oh, tell me I beseech thee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> Her husband's cruel hand took
the life he had made a burden. I heard
him swear it ere he dealt the blow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Wherefore did he kill her?
Oh, answer quickly or I shall go mad
with grief and hate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> I can tell thee little. From
my hiding-place I heard her vow never to
confess whose dagger had been found in
her apartment, and her jealous lord, in his
wild anger, murdered her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> 'Twas mine. Would it had
been sheathed in mine own breast ere it
had caused so dark a deed! Ah, Theresa,
why did I leave thee to a fate like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> Young man, grieve not; it is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
too late to save, but there is left to thee
a better thing than grief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Oh, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> Revenge!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Thou art right. I'll weep no
more. Give me thine aid, O mighty wizard,
and I will serve thee well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> Who art thou? The poor
lady's lover?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Ah, no; far nearer and far
deeper was the love I bore her, for I am
her brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> Ha, that's well! Thou wilt join
me, for I have made a vow to rest not till
that proud, sinful lord hath well atoned for
this deep crime. Spirits shall haunt him,
and the darkest phantoms that my art can
raise shall scare his soul. Wilt thou join
me in my work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> I will,&mdash;but stay! thou hast
spoken of spirits. Dread sorceress, is it
in thy power to call them up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> It is. Wilt see my skill.
Stand back while I call up a phantom
which thou canst not doubt.</p>

thy head the fearful doom thy sin deserves.

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> I see no way save that. Were
young Count Louis dead she would forget
the love that had just begun, and by
sweet words and gifts I may yet win
her. The young lord must die [<i>a groan
behind the curtain</i>]. Ha! what is that?
'Tis nothing; fie upon my fear! I'll
banish all remembrance of the fearful
shape my fancy conjured up within the
forest. I'll not do the deed myself,&mdash;I
have had enough of blood. Hugo the
bandit: he is just the man,&mdash;bold, sure
of hand, and secret. I will bribe him well,
and when the deed is done, find means to
rid me of him lest he should play me false.
I saw him in the courtyard as I entered.
Perchance he is not yet gone. Ho, without
there! Bid Hugo here if he be within
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
the castle.&mdash;He is a rough knave, but gold
will make all sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> What would my lord with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> Ay, my lord, most gladly would I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Nay, sit, good Hugo. Here is

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Dost thou know Count Louis,
whom the king lately banished?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> Nay, my lord; I never saw him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Ha! that is well. It
matters not; 'tis not of him I speak.
Take more wine, good Hugo. Listen,
there is a certain lord,&mdash;one whom I
hate. I seek his life. Here is gold&mdash;thou
hast a dagger, and can use it well.
Dost understand me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
<span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> Ay, my lord, most clearly.
Name the place and hour; count out the
gold,&mdash;I and my dagger then are thine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> 'Tis well. Now harken. In the
forest, near old Norna's cave, there is a
quiet spot. Do thou go there to-night at
sunset. Watch well, and when thou seest
a tall figure wrapped in a dark cloak, and
masked, spring forth, and do the deed.
Then fling the body down the rocks, or
hide it in some secret place. Here is one
half the gold; more shall be thine when
thou shalt show some token that the deed
is done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> Thanks, Count; I'll do thy bidding.
At sunset in the forest,&mdash;I'll be
there, and see he leaves it not alive.
Good-even, then, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Hugo, use well thy dagger, and
gold awaits thee. Yet, stay! I'll meet
thee in the wood, and pay thee there.
They might suspect if they should see
thee here again so soon. I'll meet thee
there, and so farewell.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hugo</span>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Yes; all goes well. My rival
dead, and Leonore is mine. With her I
may forget the pale face that now seems
ever looking into mine. I can almost
think the deep wound shows in her picture
yonder. But this is folly! Shame on
thee, Rodolpho. I'll think of it no more.
[<i>Turns to drink.</i> <span class="smcap">Theresa's</span> <i>face appears

Ha! what is that? Am I going mad?

<h3>NOTE TO SCENE FIFTH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> apparently impossible transformations of
this scene (when played by two actors only)
may be thus explained:&mdash;</p>

<p>The costumes of Louis and Norna, being
merely loose garments, afford opportunities for
rapid change; and the indulgent audience overlooking
such minor matters as boots and wigs,
it became an easy matter for Jo to transform
herself into either of the four characters which
she assumed on this occasion.</p>

<p>Beneath the flowing robes of the sorceress
Jo was fully dressed as Count Rodolpho.
Laid conveniently near were the black cloak,
hat, and mask of Louis,&mdash;also the white draperies
required for the ghostly Theresa.</p>

<p>Thus, Norna appears in long, gray robe, to
which are attached the hood and elf-locks of
the witch. Seeing Hugo approach she conceals
herself among the trees, thus gaining time to
don the costume of Louis, and appear to Hugo
who awaits him.</p>

<p>Hugo stabs and drags him from the stage.
Louis then throws off his disguise and becomes
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span>
Rodolpho, fully dressed for his entrance
a moment later.</p>

<p>As Hugo does not again appear, it is an easy
matter to assume the character of the spectre
and produce the sights and sounds which terrify
the guilty Count; then slipping on the witch's
robe, be ready to glide forth and close the scene
with dramatic effect.</p>

this good steel. Now, for the token [<i>takes

doubt. I will take this ring too; 'tis

remember I can take thy life as easily as
thou hast his, if thou shouldst whisper
what hath been this day done. Now go;

<div class="blockquot">[<i>Chamber in the castle of</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Leonore</span>.
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.]</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Ah, how wearily the days go
by. No tidings of Count Louis, and Count
Rodolpho urges on his suit so earnestly.
I must accept his hand to-day, or refuse his
love, and think no more of Louis. I know
not how to choose. Rodolpho loves me:
I am an orphan and alone, and in his
lovely home I may be happy. I have
heard it whispered that he is both stern
and cruel, yet methinks it cannot be,&mdash;he
is so tender when with me. Ah, would
I could forget Count Louis! He hath
never told his love, and doubtless thinks
no more of her who treasures up his gentle
words, and cannot banish them, even when
another offers a heart and home few would
refuse. How shall I answer Count Rodolpho
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
when he comes? I do not love
him as I should, and yet it were no hard
task to learn with so fond a teacher. Shall
I accept his love, or shall I reject?</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Norna</span> <i>suddenly appears.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> Reject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Who art thou? Leave me,
or I call for aid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> Nay, lady, fear not. I come
not here to harm thee, but to save thee
from a fate far worse than death. I am
old Norna of the forest, and though they
call me witch and sorceress, I am a woman
yet, and with a heart to pity and to love.
I would save thy youth and beauty from
the blight I fear will fall upon thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Save me! from what? How
knowest thou I am in danger; and from
what wouldst thou save me, Norna?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> From Lord Rodolpho, lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Ah! and why from him?
Tell on, I'll listen to thee now. He hath
offered me his heart and hand. Why
should I not accept them, Norna?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
<span class="smcap">Norna.</span> That heart is filled with dark
and evil passions, and that hand is stained
with blood. Ay, lady, well mayst thou
start. I will tell thee more. The splendid
home he would lead thee to is darkened by
a fearful crime, and his fair palace haunted
by the spirit of a murdered wife.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Leonore</span> <i>starts up.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Wife, sayest thou? He told
me he was never wed. Mysterious woman,
tell me more! How dost thou know 'tis
true, and wherefore was it done? I have
a right to know. Oh, speak, and tell me
all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> For that have I come hither.
He hath been wed to a lady, young and
lovely as thyself. He kept her prisoner in
his splendid home, and by neglect and
cruelty he broke as warm and true a heart
as ever beat in woman's breast. Her
brother stole unseen to cheer and comfort
her, and this aroused her lord's suspicions,
and he bid her to confess who
was her unknown friend. She would not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
yield her brother to his hate, and he in
his wild anger murdered her. I heard his
cruel words, her prayers for mercy, and I
stood beside the lifeless form and marked
the blow his evil hand had given her.
And there I vowed I would avenge the
deed, and for this have I come hither to
warn thee of thy danger. He loves thee
only for thy wealth, and when thou art his,
will wrong thee as he hath the meek Theresa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> How shall I ever thank thee
for this escape from sorrow and despair?
I did not love him, but I am alone, and his
kind words were sweet and tender. I
thought with him I might be happy yet,
but&mdash;Ah, how little did I dream of sin like
this! Thank Heaven, 'tis not too late!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> How wilt thou answer Lord
Rodolpho now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> I will answer him with all the
scorn and loathing that I feel. I fear him
not, and he shall learn how his false vows
are despised, and his sins made known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norna.</span> 'Tis well; but stay,&mdash;be thou
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
not too proud. Speak fairly, and reject
him courteously; for he will stop at nought
in his revenge if thou but rouse his hatred.
And now, farewell. I'll watch above thee,
and in thy hour of danger old Norna will
be nigh. Stay, give me some token, by
which thou wilt know the messenger I may
find cause to send thee. The fierce Count
will seek to win thee, and repay thy scorn
by all the evil his cruel heart can bring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Take this ring, and I will
trust whoever thou mayst send with it.
I owe thee much, and, believe me, I am
grateful for thy care, and will repay thee
by my confidence and truth. Farewell,

and so true is stained with fearful crimes!
Poor, murdered lady! Have I escaped a

Now, heart, be firm and he shall enter here

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rodolpho</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Sweet lady, I am here to learn
my fate. I have told my love, and thou
hast listened; I have asked thy hand,
and thou hast not refused it. I have offered
all that I possess,&mdash;my home, my
heart. Again I lay them at thy feet,
beloved Leonore. Oh, wilt thou but accept
them, poor tho' they be, and in
return let me but claim this fair hand
as mine own?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Takes her hand and kneels before her.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore</span> [<i>withdrawing her hand</i>]. My
lord, forgive me, but I cannot grant it.
When last we met thou didst bid me ask
my heart if it could love thee. It hath
answered, "Nay." I grieve I cannot make
a fit return for all you offer, but I have no
love to give, and without it this poor hand
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
were worthless. There are others far more
fit to grace thy home than I. Go, win thyself
a loving bride, and so forget Leonore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> What hath changed thee thus
since last we met. Then wert thou kind,
and listened gladly to my love. Now
there is a scornful smile upon thy lips,
and a proud light in thine eye. What
means this? Why dost thou look so coldly
on me, Leonore? Who has whispered false
tales in thine ear? Believe them not. I
am as true as Heaven to thee; then do
not cast away the heart so truly thine.
Smile on me, dearest; thou art my first,
last, only love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> 'Tis false, my lord! Hast
thou so soon forgot <i>Theresa</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> What! Who told thee that accursed
tale? What dost thou mean,
Leonore?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> I mean thy sinful deeds are
known. Thou hast asked me why I will
not wed thee, and I answer, I will not give
my hand unto a murderer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
<span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Murderer! No more of this!
Thy tale is false; forget it, and I will
forgive the idle words. Now listen; I
came hither to receive thy answer to my
suit. Think ere thou decide. Thou art
an orphan, unprotected and alone. I am
powerful and great. Wilt thou take my
love, and with it honor, wealth, happiness,
and ease, or my hate, which will surely
follow thee and bring down desolation on
thee and all thou lovest? Now choose,
my hatred, or my love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> My lord, I scorn thy love,
and I defy thy hate. Work thy will, I
fear thee not. I am not so unprotected
as thou thinkest. There are unseen
friends around me who will save in every
peril, and who are sworn to take revenge
on thee for thy great sins. This is my
answer; henceforth we are strangers; now
leave me. I would be alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Not yet, proud lady. If thou
wilt not love, I'll make thee learn to fear
the heart thou hast so scornfully cast
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
away. Let thy friends guard thee well;
thou wilt need their care when I begin
my work of vengeance. Thou mayst
smile, but thou shalt rue the day when
Count Rodolpho asked and was refused.
But I will yet win thee, and then beware!
And when thou dost pray for mercy on thy
knees, remember the haughty words thou
hast this day spoken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Do thy worst, murderer;
spirits will watch above me, and thou
canst not harm. Adieu, my lord.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Leonore</span>.</p>

win her yet, and wring her proud heart
till she shall bend her haughty head and

none to answer to thy call. All here
are my slaves, and none dare disobey.

Where are thy proud words now? hast

lips, no anger in those beseeching eyes?
Where are thy friends? Why come they
not to aid thee? Said I not truly my
revenge was sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Oh, pardon me, and pity!
See, I will kneel to thee, pray, weep, if
thou wilt only let me go. Forgive my
careless words! Oh, Count Rodolpho, take
me home, and I will forget this cruel
jest [<i>kneels</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Ha, ha! It is no jest, and
thou hast no home but this. Didst thou
not come willingly? I used no force;
and all disguise is fair in love. Nay,
kneel not to me. Did I not say thou
wouldst bend thy proud head, and sue for
mercy, and I would deny it? Where is
thy defiance now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore</span> [<i>rising</i>]. I'll kneel no more
to thee. The first wild fear is past, and
thou shalt find me at thy feet no more.
As I told thee <i>then</i>, I tell thee <i>now</i>,&mdash;thine
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>
I will never be; and think not I will fail
or falter at thy threats. Contempt of thee
is too strong for fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Not conquered yet. Time will
teach thee to speak more courteously to
thy master. Ah, thou mayst well look
upon these bawbles. They were thy
lover's once. This ring was taken from
his lifeless hand; this dagger from his
bleeding breast, as he lay within the forest
whence I led thee. This scroll I found
next his heart when it had ceased to beat.
I lured thee hither with it, and won my
sweet revenge. [<span class="smcap">Leonore</span> <i>sinks down weeping.</i>]
Now rest thee; for when the castle
clock strikes ten, I shall come to lead thee
to the altar. The priest is there,&mdash;this

remember,&mdash;there is no escape, and thou
art mine forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore</span> [<i>starting up</i>]. Never! I shall
be free when thou mayst think help past

and an arm to save, when earthly aid is

lost. Thine I shall never be! Thou
mayst seek me; I shall be gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Thou wilt need thy prayers. I

now to guard me? Is there no help?
Nor tears nor prayers can melt that cruel
heart, and I am in his power. Ha! what
is that?&mdash;<i>his</i> dagger, taken from his dying
breast. How gladly would he have drawn
it forth to save his poor Leonore! Alas,
that hand is cold forever! But I must
be calm. He shall see how a weak

liberty by death [<i>takes the dagger; clock

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Dangers seem thickening round
me. Some secret spy is watching me unseen,&mdash;I
fear 'tis Hugo, spite the gold I
gave him, and the vows he made. A
higher bribe may win the secret from him,
and then I am undone. Pedro hath told
me that a stranger, cloaked and masked,
was lurking near the castle on the night
when Leonore so strangely vanished [<i>a
laugh</i>]. Ha!&mdash;what's that?&mdash;methought
I heard that mocking laugh again! I am
grown fearful as a child since that most
awful night. Well, well, let it pass! If
Hugo comes to-night, obedient to the message
I have sent, I'll see he goes not hence
alive. This cup shalt be thy last, good
Hugo! [<i>Puts poison in the wine-cup.</i>] He
comes,&mdash;now for my revenge! [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
<span class="smcap">Hugo</span>.] Ah, Hugo, welcome! How hath
it fared with thee since last we met?
Thou lookest weary,&mdash;here is wine; sit
and refresh thyself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> I came not hither, Count Rodolpho,
to seek wine, but gold. Hark ye!
I am poor; thou art rich, but in my
power, for proud and noble though thou
art, the low-born Hugo can bring death
and dishonor on thy head by whispering
one word to the king. Ha!&mdash;now give
me gold or I will betray thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Thou bold villain, what means
this? I paid thee well, and thou didst
vow to keep my secret. Threaten me not.
Thou art in my power, and shall never
leave this room alive. I fear thee not.
My menials are at hand,&mdash;yield thyself;
thou art fairly caught, and cannot now
escape me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> Nay, not so fast, my lord. One
blast upon my horn, and my brave band,
concealed below, will answer to my call.
Ha! ha! thou art caught, my lord. Thy
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;65]</span>
life is in my hands, and thou must purchase
it by fifty good pistoles paid down to
me; if not, I will charge thee with the
crime thou didst bribe me to perform, and
thus win a rich reward. Choose,&mdash;thy
life is nought to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Do but listen, Hugo. I have no
gold; smile if thou wilt, but I am poor.
This castle only is mine own, and I am
seeking now a rich young bride whose
wealth will hide my poverty. Be just,
good Hugo, and forgive the harsh words
I have spoken. Wait till I am wed, and
I will pay thee well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> That will I not. I'll have no
more of thee, false lord! The king will
well reward me, and thou mayst keep
thy gold. Farewell! Thou wilt see me
once again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Stay, Hugo, stay! Give me but
time; I may obtain the gold. Wait a
little, and it shall be thine. Wilt thou
not drink? 'Tis the wine thou likest so
well. See! I poured it ready for thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;66]</span>
<span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> Nay; I will serve myself. Wine
of thy mixing would prove too strong for
me [<i>sits down and drinks.</i> <span class="smcap">Rodolpho</span> <i>paces
up and down waiting a chance to stab him</i>].
Think quickly, my good lord; I must be
gone [<i>turns his head.</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>raises his dagger.</i>
<span class="smcap">Hugo</span> <i>rising</i>]. I'll wait no more; 'tis
growing late, and I care not to meet the
spirits which I hear now haunt thy castle.
Well, hast thou the gold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rod.</span> Not yet; but if thou wilt wait&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> I tell thee I will not. I'll be
deceived no longer. Thou art mine, and
I'll repay thy scornful words and sinful
deeds by a prisoner's cell. And so, adieu,
my lord. Escape is useless, for thou wilt
be watched. Hugo is the master now!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hugo</span>.</p>

thee yet. I will disguise myself, and

me, and that is flight. I must leave all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;67]</span>

sin on my head, and fear within my heart.
Will the sun never set? How slow the
hours pass! In the first gloom of night,
concealed in yonder old monk's robe, I'll
silently glide forth, and fly from Hugo

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> I fear it will cause thee sorrow,

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Forgive me if I make thee
weep: I had a friend,&mdash;most dear to me.
He loved a gentle lady, but ere he could
tell her this, he died, and bid me vow to
watch above her whom he loved, and
guard her with my life. I took the
vow: that lady was thyself, that friend
Count Louis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Ah, Louis! Louis! that heart

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Thou didst love him, lady?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dearest Lady,</span>&mdash;Wilt thou pardon the bold
words I here address to thee, and forgive me if
I grieve one on whom I would bestow only the
truest joy. In giving peace to thy heart I have
lost mine own. I was thy guide and comforter,
and soon, unknown to thee, thy lover. I love
thee, Leonore, fondly and truly; and here I ask,
wilt thou accept the offering of a heart that will
forever cherish thee. If thou canst grant this
blessed boon, fling from the casement the white
rose I send thee; but if thou canst not accept
my love, forgive me for avowing it, and drop the
cypress bough I have twined about the rose. I
will not pain thee to refuse in words,&mdash;the
mournful token is enough. Ask thine own heart

<p>Oh, how shall I reply to this,&mdash;how
blight a love so tender and so true? I
have longed to show my gratitude, to prove
how I have revered this noble friend. The
hour has come when I may make his happiness,
and prove my trust. And yet
my heart belongs to Louis, and I cannot
love another. Adrian was his friend; he
loved him, and confided me to him. Nobly
hath he fulfilled that trust, and where
could I find a truer friend than he who
hath saved me from danger and from death,
and now gives me the power to gladden
and to bless his life. Adrian, if thou wilt
accept a sister's love and friendship, they
shall be thine. Louis, forgive me if I wrong
thee; for though I yield my hand, my heart
is thine forever. This rose, Adrian, to thee;
this mournful cypress shall be mine in
memory of my blighted hopes [<i>goes to the</i>

by the fountain for the token that shall
bring him joy or sorrow. Thou noble

longer, for thus will Leonore repay the
debt of gratitude she owes thee [<i>flings the
rose from the window</i>]. He hath placed it in
his bosom, and is coming hither to pour
forth his thanks for the poor gift bestowed.
I will tell him all, and if he will accept, then
I am his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Dear lady, how can I tell thee
the joy thou hast given me. This blessed

pardon and consent. Oh, Leonore, canst
thou love a nameless stranger who is so
unworthy the great boon thou givest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Listen, Adrian, ere thou dost
thank me for a divided heart. Thou hast
been told my love for Louis; he was thy
friend, and well thou knowest how true
and tender was the heart he gave me. He
hath gone, and with him rests my first deep
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;81]</span>
love. Thou art my only friend and my
protector; thou hast won my gratitude and
warmest friendship. I can offer thee a sister's
pure affection,&mdash;my hand is thine;
and here I pledge thee that as thou hast
watched o'er me, so now thy happiness
shall be my care, thy love my pride and
joy. Here is my hand,&mdash;wilt thou accept
it, Adrian?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> I will. I would not seek to
banish from thy heart the silent love thou
bearest Louis. I am content if thou wilt
trust me with thy happiness, and give me
the sweet right to guide and guard thee
through the pilgrimage of life. God bless
thee, dearest.</p>

for thee? I have now won the right to
cheer thy sorrows. Have faith in thy
Leonore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Thou hast a right to know
all, and ere long thou shalt. My mysterious
vow will now soon be fulfilled, and then no
doubt shall part us. Thou hast placed thy
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;82]</span>
trust in me, and I have not betrayed it, and
now I ask a greater boon of thy confiding
heart. Wilt thou consent to wed me ere I
cast aside this mask forever? Believe me,
thou wilt not regret it,&mdash;'tis part of my
vow; one last trial, and I will prove to thee
thou didst not trust in vain. Forgive if I
have asked too much. Nay, thou canst
not grant so strange a boon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> I can&mdash;I will. I did but
pause, for it seemed strange thou couldst
not let me look upon thy face. But think
not that I fear to grant thy wish. Thy
heart is pure and noble, and that thou canst
not mask. As I trusted thee through my
despair, so now I trust thee in my joy.
Canst thou ask more, dear friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Ever trust me thus! Ah,
Leonore, how can I repay thee? My love,
my life, are all I can give thee for the
blessed gift thou hast bestowed. A time
will come when all this mystery shall cease
and we shall part no more. Now must I

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> At length the hour hath

him whom I this day have sworn to love

been rash in wedding one I know not, but

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> No dream, my Leonore; it

hardly,&mdash;pardon me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Oh, Louis, husband, I have
nought to pardon; my life, my liberty,
my happiness,&mdash;all, all, I owe to thee.
How shall I repay thee? [<i>Weeps upon his
bosom.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> By banishing these tears, dear
love, and smiling on me as you used to do.
Here, love, sit beside me while I tell thee
my most strange tale, and then no longer
shalt thou wonder. Art happy now thy
Adrian hath flung by his mask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Happy! What deeper joy
can I desire than that of seeing thy dear
face once more? But tell me, Louis, how
couldst thou dwell so long beside me and<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
not cheer my bitter sorrow when I grieved
for thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Ah, Leonore, thou wouldst not
reproach me, didst thou know how hard
I struggled with my heart, lest I should
by some tender word, some fond caress,
betray myself when thou didst grieve for
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Why didst thou fear to tell
thy Leonore? She would have aided and
consoled thee. Why didst thou let me
pine in sorrow at thy side, when but a
word had filled my heart with joy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Dearest, I dared not. Thou
knowest I was banished by the hate of
that fiend Rodolpho. I had a fair and
gentle sister, whom he wed, and after
cruelty and coldness that I dread to think
of now, he murdered her. I sought old
Norna's aid. She promised it, and well hath
kept her word. When Count Rodolpho's
ruffian left me dying in the forest, she
saved, and brought me back to life. She
bade me take a solemn vow not to betray<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;87]</span>
myself, and to aid her in her vengeance
on the murderer of Theresa. Nor could
I own my name and rank, lest it should
reach the king who had banished me.
The vow I took, and have fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> And is there no danger now?
Art thou safe, dear Louis, from the Count?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Fear not, my love. He will
never harm us more; his crimes are
known. The king hath pardoned me. I
have won thee back. He is an outcast,
and old Norna's spells have well-nigh
driven him mad. My sister, thou art well
avenged! Alas! alas! would I could have
saved, and led thee hither to this happy
home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Ah, grieve not, Louis; she is
happy now, and thy Leonore will strive to
fill her place. Hast thou told me all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> Nay, love. Thou knowest how
I watched above thee, but thou canst
never know the joy thy faithful love for
one thou mourned as dead hath brought
me. I longed to cast aside the dark disguise<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;88]</span>
I had vowed to wear, but dared not
while Rodolpho was at liberty. Now all
is safe. I have tried thy love, and found
it true. Oh, may I prove most worthy of
it, dearest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonore.</span> Louis, how can I love too
faithfully the friend who, 'mid his own
grief and danger, loved and guarded me.
I trusted thee as Adrian; as Louis I shall
love thee until death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis.</span> And I shall prize most tenderly
the faithful heart that trusted me through
doubt and mystery. Now life is bright
and beautiful before us, and may you
never sorrow that thou gav'st thy heart to
Louis, and thy hand to Adrian the "Black

Ah, no; although most swift of foot and

thee. I swore to win both gold and vengeance.
The king hath offered high reward
for thy poor head, and it is mine.
Methinks it may cheer your solitude my
lord, so I came hither on my way to bear
thy death warrant to the captain of the

Hark ye! were this destroyed, thou
might'st escape ere another were prepared.
How dost thou like the plot?</p>

Give me not up to the king! I'll be thy

thee countless gold. Ah, pity, and save
me, Hugo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span> Ha, ha! I did but jest.
Thinkest thou I could forego the joy of
seeing thy proud head laid low? Where
was thy countless gold when I did ask it<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
of thee? No, no; thou canst not tempt
me to forget my vengeance. 'Tis Hugo's

murdered sister's fate, and he hath joined
her in her work of vengeance, and foiled
thee in thy sinful plots. I saved Leonore,

<h3>SCENE FIRST.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>A thick wood. Storm coming on.
Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ernest</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> This summer sky, darkened
by storm, is a fit emblem of my life. O
happy England, why did I leave thee;
why let dreams of fame and honor win me
from a home, to wander now a lonely and
bewildered fugitive? But why do I repine?
Life, health, and a brave heart yet
are mine; and 'mid all my peril, God may
send some joy to cheer me on to happiness
and honor. Hist! a footstep. 'Tis
a light one, but a Moorish foe steals like<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;98]</span>
a serpent on his prey. I'll hide me here,
and if need be I'll sell my life as a brave
man should [<i>conceals himself among the trees</i>].</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Zara</span>, <i>weeping.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Heaven shield me! Whither shall
I turn? Alone in this wild forest, where
may I find a friend to help. The dark
storm gathers fast, and I am shelterless.
The fierce Spaniard may be wandering
nigh, and I dare not call for aid. Mistress
of a hundred slaves, here must I perish for
one to lead me. Father, the faint heart
turns to thee when earthly help is past;
hear and succor thy poor child now, who
puts her trust in thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest</span> [<i>coming forward</i>]. Lady, thy
prayer is heard. God hath not sent me
here in vain. How may I best serve
thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Gentle stranger, pity and protect
a hapless maid who puts her faith in
thee. Guide me from this wild wood, and
all the thanks a grateful heart can give
are thine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;99]</span>
<span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> I ask no higher honor than
to shield so fair a flower from the storm,
or from rude hands that may harm it.
But how chanced it, lady, that thou art
wandering thus unattended? 'Tis unsafe
for youth and beauty while the Spanish
army is so near.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> It was a foolish fancy led me
hither, and dearly am I punished. Journeying
from a distant convent to my
father's home, while my attendants rested
by a spring I wandered through the wood,
unthinking of the danger, till turning to
retrace my steps, I found myself lost and
alone. I feared to call, and but for thee,
kind stranger, might have never seen my
home again. Ask not my name, but tell
me thine, that in my prayers I may remember
one who has so aided me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> It were uncourteous to refuse
thy bidding, lady. Ernest L'Estrange is
the name now honored by the poor service
I may do thee. In the Spanish army I
came hither, and fear I have seen the last<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;100]</span>
of home or friends. The Moors now seek
my life, and ere I can rejoin my ranks, I
may be a slave. But the storm draws
nearer. Let me lead thee to some shelter,
lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Methinks I see a glimmer yonder.
Let us seek it, for with thee I fear
no longer. I can only give thee thanks,
most noble stranger; yet a day may come
when she for whom thou dost now risk thy
life may find a fit return, worthy thy
courtesy to one so helpless and forlorn.</p>

<h3>SCENE SECOND.</h3>

<p>[<i>Room in the castle of</i> <span class="smcap">Bernardo</span>.
<span class="smcap">Zara</span> <i>alone</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> 'Tis strange how the thought
haunts me still. Long months have passed
since last I saw that noble face, and yet
those gentle eyes look on me! Ernest!&mdash;'tis
a sweet English name, and 'twas a
noble English heart that felt such tender
pity for a helpless maid. Hark! my father's
step! He comes to tell of victories
gained, of kingdoms won. Oh, would he
might bring some word of him I have so
longed to see and thank once more!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bernardo</span> <i>with a casket.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Joyful tidings, Zara! Grenada
is free. Here, love, are gems for thee;
they have shone on many a fair lady's
neck, but none more fair than thine. And
here are things more precious far to me
than all their gold and gems,&mdash;a goodly<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;102]</span>
list of prisoners taken in the fight, and
sent to cool their Spanish blood in our
deepest cells. Ah, many a proud name
is here,&mdash;Ferdinand Navarre, Carlos of
Arragon, Lord L'Estrange, and Baron Lisle.
But, child, what ails thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara</span> [<i>starting up</i>]. L'Estrange! Is he
a prisoner too? Hast thou read aright?
Father, Father, it was he who saved me
from a bitter death in yonder forest. I
never told his name lest it should anger
thee. For my sake spare him, and let the
gratitude thou hast felt for that kind deed
soften thy heart to the brave stranger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Nay, Zara! He is thy country's
foe, and must be sacrificed to save her
honor. 'Twas a simple deed thou hast
spoken of. What brave man but would
save a fair girl from storms or danger?
'Tis a foolish thought, love; let it pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Oh, Father! I who never bent
the knee to man before, implore thee thus
[<i>kneels</i>]. Be merciful! Leave not the English
lord to the dark and fearful doom that<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;103]</span>
waits him. I know too well the life-long
captivity, more terrible than death itself,
that is his fate. Oh, speak! Say he is
forgiven, Father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Nay, what wild dream is this?
Listen, child! I tell thee he must suffer
the captivity he merits as thy country's
foe. He hath borne arms against thy
king, slain thy kindred, brought woe and
desolation thro' the land our fathers gave
us. And thou wouldst plead for him!
Shame on thee! Thou art no true daughter
of thy suffering country if thou canst
waste one tear on those who were well
lodged in our most dreary dungeons. Call
thy pride to aid thee, Zara, and be worthy
of thy noble name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Father, thou hast often told me
woman's lot was 'mid the quiet scenes of
home, and that no thoughts of fame or
glory should lie within a heart where only
gentleness and love should dwell; but I
have learned to honor bravery and noble
deeds, and I would pledge my troth for the<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;104]</span>
noble stranger. See the English knight,
and if he win thee not to gratitude, thou
art not the tender father who, through
long years, hath so loved and cherished
thy motherless child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Nay, Zara, nay; honor is a sterner
master than a father's love. I cannot free
the captive till the king who hath sealed
his doom shall pardon also. The prisoners
are men of rank, and for thy country's
sake must die. Forget thy foolish fancy,
child, and set thy young heart on some
fairer toys than these false English lords.
Adieu, love; I must to the council.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bernardo</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Ah, there was a time when
Zara's lightest wish was gladly granted.
This cruel war hath sadly changed my
father; he hath forgotten all his generous
pity for suffering and sorrow. But
my work is yet undone, and the stranger is
a captive. He <i>shall</i> be free, and I will pay
the debt of gratitude I owe him. I will
brave my father's anger; but whom can<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;105]</span>
I trust to aid me? Ha! Selim! He is
old and faithful, and will obey [<i>claps her
hands</i>].</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Selim</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selim.</span> Your bidding, lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Selim, thou hast known me from
my birth, and served me well. I have
done thee many a kindness. Wilt thou
grant me one that shalt repay all that I
have ever shown to thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selim.</span> Lady, thou hast made a slave's
life happy by thy care, and through the long
years I have served thee, hast never bid
me do aught that was not right. If my
poor services can aid thee now, they are
most gladly thine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Listen, Selim, while I tell thee
what I seek. Thou knowest an English
soldier saved and led me from the forest
yonder, and thou knowest how my father
thanked and blessed the unknown friend
who had so aided me. Yet now, when it is
in his power to show the gratitude he felt,
he will not, and has doomed the man he<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span>
once longed to honor to a lonely cell to
pine away a brave heart's life in sorrow
and captivity. I would show that gentle
stranger that a woman never can forget.
I would free him. Thou hast the keys.
This is the service I now crave of thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selim.</span> Lady, canst thou ask me to
betray the trust my lord, thy father, hath
been pleased to place in me? Ask anything
but this, and gladly will I obey thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Ah, must I ever ask and be
refused? Selim, listen! Thou hast a
daughter; she is fair and young, and thou
hast often sighed that she should be a
slave. If thou wilt aid me now, the hour
the chains fall from the English captive's
limbs, that hour shalt see thy daughter
free, and never more a slave. If thou
wilt win this joy for her, then grant my
prayer, and she is free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selim.</span> Oh, lady, lady, tempt me not!
much as I love my child, I love mine
honor more. I cannot aid thee to deceive
thy father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;107]</span>
<span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Nay, Selim, I do not ask it of
thee. The proud name my father bears
shall ne'er be stained by one false deed of
mine. I ask thee but to lead me to the
prisoner's cell, that I may offer freedom,
and tell him woman's gratitude can never
fail, nor woman's heart forget. And if my
father ask thee aught of this, thou shalt
answer freely. Tell him all, and trust his
kindness to forgive; and if evil come <i>I</i>
will bear it bravely,&mdash;thou shalt not
suffer. Thou shalt win thy fair child's
freedom, and my fadeless thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selim.</span> Thou hast conquered, lady;
and for the blessed gift that is my reward,
I will brave all but treachery and dishonor.
Thou shalt find thy truest slaves
in the old man and his daughter [<i>kneels and
gives the keys</i>].</p>

<p>Zara. Thanks, good Selim, thanks;
thou shalt find a grateful friend in her
thou hast served so well. I will disguise
me as a female slave, and thou shalt
lead me to the cell. Now go; I will join<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;108]</span>
thee anon. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Selim</span>.] Oh, Ernest,
Ernest! thy brave heart shall pine no
longer. <ins title="Original had An ther">

Chains cannot bind, nor dungeons hold
when woman's love and gratitude are
thine.</p>

<h3>SCENE THIRD.</h3>


<p class="center">[<i>Dungeon in the castle of</i> <span class="smcap">Bernardo</span>. <span class="smcap">Ernest L'Estrange</span>, <i>chained.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> So end my dreams of fame
and honor! A life-long captive, or a sultan's
slave are all that fate has left me
now. Yet, 'mid disgrace and sorrow, one
thought can cheer me yet, and one sweet
vision brighten e'en my dreary lot. I
have served my country well, and won the
thanks of Spain's most lovely daughter.
Sweet lady, little does she dream amid her
happiness that memories of her are all
now left to cheer a captive's heart. But
hist!&mdash;a footstep on the stair. Perchance
they come to lead me forth to new captivity
or death. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Zara</span>, <i>disguised as
a slave</i>] Ah, who comes here to cheer
the cell of the poor captive?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;110]</span><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Captive no longer, if life and
liberty be dear to thee. Say but the
word, and ere the sun sets thou shalt be
free amid the hills of Spain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> Who art thou, coming like a
spirit to my lonely cell, bringing hopes of
freedom? Tell me, what hath moved thee
to such pity for an unknown stranger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Not unknown to her I serve.
She hath not forgot thee, noble stranger.
When thou didst lead her from the dim
wood, she said a day might come when
she, so weak and helpless then, might find
some fit reward for one who risked his life
for her. That hour hath come, and she
hath sent her poor slave hither, and with
her thanks and blessing to speed thee on
thy way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> And is she near, and did she
send thee to repay my simple deed with
one like this? Ah, tell her name! Where
doth she dwell, and whence the power to
set me free?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;111]</span>
<span class="smcap">Zara.</span> I may not tell thee more than
this. Her father is Bernardo of Castile.
She heard thy name among the captives
doomed, and seeks to save thee; for if
thou dost not fly, a most cruel death awaits
thee. Listen to her prayer, and cast these
chains away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> It cannot be. Much as I love
my freedom, I love my honor more; and I
am bound until my conqueror shall give
back my plighted word, to seek no freedom
till he shall bid me go. Nay, do not
sigh, kind friend; I am no longer sad.
From this day forth captivity is sweet.
Tell thy fair mistress all my thanks are
hers; but I may not take the gift she
offers, for with freedom comes dishonor,
and I cannot break my word to her stern
father. Tell her she hath made my fetters
light, this cell a happy home, by the sweet
thought that she is near and still remembers
one who looks upon the hour when
first we met as the happiest he hath
known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;112]</span><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> If there be power in woman's
gratitude, thou shalt yet be free, and
with thine honor yet unstained. She will
not rest till all the debt she owes thee
is repaid. Farewell, and think not Zara
will forget [<i>turns to go; her veil falls</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest</span> [<i>starting</i>]. Lady!&mdash;and is it
thou? Ah, leave me not! Let me thank
thee for the generous kindness which has
made a lone heart happy by the thought
that even in this wild land there is still
one to remember the poor stranger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Pardon what may seem to thee
unmaidenly and bold; but thou wert in
danger; there were none whom I could
trust. Gratitude hath bid me come, and
I am here. Again I ask, nay, I implore
thee, let me have the joy of giving freedom
to one brave English heart. England is
thy home: wouldst thou not tread its
green shores once again? Are there no
fond hearts awaiting thy return? Ah, can
I not tempt thee by all that man most
loves, to fly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;113]</span><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> Lady, my own heart pleads
more earnestly than even thy sweet voice;
but those kind eyes were better dimmed
with tears for my sad death than be turned
coldly from me as one who had stained
the high name he bore. And liberty were
dearly purchased if I left mine honor here
behind. Ask me no more; for till thy
father sets me free, I am his prisoner here.
Ah, dearest lady, thou hast made this lone
cell bright, and other chains than these
now hold me here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Then it must be. Much as I
grieve for thy captivity, I shall honor
thee the more for thy unfailing truth, more
prized than freedom, home, or friends.
And though I cannot save thee now, thou
shalt find a Moorish maiden true and fearless
as thyself. Farewell! May happy
thoughts of home cheer this dark cell
till I have won the power to set thee
free.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Zara</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;114]</span>

What, ho! Zara, where art

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> 'Tis joy, not sorrow, Zara, gives
this fierce light to mine eye. I have
hated, and am avenged. This one frail
scroll is dearer far to me than all the
wealth of Spain, for 'tis the death-knell
of the English lords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;116]</span><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Ay, Zara,&mdash;all; ere to-morrow's
sun shall set they will sleep forever, and
a good deed will be well done. I hate
them, and their paltry lives can ill repay
the sorrow they have wrought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Let me see the fatal paper.
[<i>Takes the scroll; aside.</i>] Yes, <i>his</i> name
is here. Ah, how strange that these few
lines can doom brave hearts to such a
death! [<i>Aloud.</i>] Father, 'tis a fearful
thing to hold such power over human life.
Ah, bid me tear the scroll, and win for
thee the thanks of those thy generous
pity saves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> [<i>seizing the paper</i>]. Not for thy life,
child! Revenge is sweet, and I have waited
long for mine. The king hath granted
this; were it destroyed, the captives might
escape ere I could win another. Nay,
Zara, this is dearer to me than thy most
priceless gems. To-night it shall be well
guarded 'neath my pillow. Go to thy
flowers, child. These things are not for
thee,&mdash;thou art growing pale and sad.<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;117]</span>
Remember, Zara, thou art nobly born,
and let no foolish pity win thee to forget
it.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bernardo</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Oh, Father, Father, whom I have
so loved and honored, now so cold, so pitiless.
The spirit of revenge hath entered
thy kind heart, and spread an evil blight
o'er all the flowers that blossomed there.
I cannot win him back to tenderness, and
Ernest, thou must perish. I cannot save
thee,&mdash;perhaps 'tis better so; but oh,
'twill be a bitter parting! [<i>Weeps.</i>] Nay,
nay, it shall <i>not</i> be! When this wild hate
hath passed, my father will repent. Alas!
't will be too late. <i>I</i> will save him from
that sorrow when he shall find he hath
wronged a noble heart, and slain the friend
he should have saved. But stay! how
shall I best weave my plot? That fatal
paper, once destroyed, I will implore and
plead so tenderly, my father will repent;
and ere another scroll can reach his hands,
I will have won thy freedom, Ernest!<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;118]</span>
This night beneath his pillow it will be;

<h3>SCENE SIXTH.</h3>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Zara's</span> <i>chamber</i>.
<span class="smcap">Zara</span> <i>alone</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> The long, sleepless night at
length hath passed. The paper is destroyed,
and now nought remains but to
confess the deed, and brave my father's
anger.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bernardo</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Zara!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara</span> [<i>starts</i>]. Why so stern, my father?
Hath thy poor Zara angered thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> I have trusted thee as few would
trust a child. Thou art fair and gentle,
and I had thought true. Never, Zara, till
now hast thou deceived me; and if thou
wouldst keep thy father's love and trust,
I bid thee answer truly. Didst thou, in
the dead of night steal to my pillow, and
bear hence the paper I had told thee
would be there? Thy slave girl, Zillah,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;121]</span>
missed thee from thy couch, and saw thee
enter there. She feared to follow, but
none other came within my chamber, and
this morn the scroll is gone. Now answer,
Zara! Didst thou take the warrant, and
where is it now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Burnt to ashes, and scattered to
the winds. I have never stained my soul
with falsehood, and I will not now. Oh,
Father! I have loved and honored thee
through the long years thou hast watched
above me. How could I love on when
thou hadst stained with blood that hand
that blessed me when a child, how honor
when thou hadst repaid noble deeds with
death? Forgive me that I plead for those
thou hast doomed! I alone am guilty,&mdash;let
thine anger fall on me; but, Father, I
implore thee, leave this evil deed undone.
[<i>Kneels.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Thou canst plead well for thy
father's and thy country's foe. What
strange fancy hath possessed thee, Zara?
Thou hast never wept, tho' many a Christian<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;122]</span>
knight hath pined and died within
these walls; and even now, methinks, thou
speakest more of gratitude than mercy,
and seem strangely earnest for the English
lord who did thee some small service long
ago. Speak, Zara! wouldst thou save
them <i>all</i>? Were I to grant thee all their
lives save his, wouldst thou be content
to let <i>him</i> die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Nay, Father; but for his tender
care thou wouldst have no daughter now
to stand before thee, pleading for the life
he bravely risked in saving mine. Oh,
would I had died amid the forest leaves
ere I had brought such woe to him, and
lived to lose my father's love! [<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Listen, Zara! Little as I know
of woman's heart, I have learned to read
thine own; and if I err not, thou hast
dared to love this stranger. Ha! is it
so? Girl, I command thee to forget that
love, and leave him to his fate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Never! I will not forget the
love that like a bright star hath come to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;123]</span>
cheer my lonely heart. I will <i>not</i> forget
the noble friend who, 'mid his fiercest foes,
could brave all dangers to restore an unknown
maiden to her home. And when
I offered liberty (for I have disobeyed and
dared to seek his cell), he would not break
the word he had plighted, Father, unto
thee. He bade me tempt him not, for
death were better than dishonor. Ah,
canst thou doom him to a felon's death?
Then do it; and the hour that sees that
true heart cease to beat, that hour thou
hast lost the child who would have loved
and clung to thee through life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Child, thou hast moved me
strangely. I would grant thy prayer, but
thou shalt never wed one of that accursed
race. I bear no hate to the young lord,
save that he is thy country's foe; and if he
gains his freedom, he will win thee too.
By Allah! it shall never be. Yet, listen,
Zara! If I grant his life wilt thou ask
no more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> 'T is all I ask; grant me but<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;124]</span>
this, and I will give thee all the gratitude
and love this poor heart can bestow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Then 'tis done. Yet hold! the
price that thou must pay for this dear
boon is large. Thou must swear never to
see him more; must banish love, nay, even
memory of that fatal hour when first he
saw and saved thee. If thou wilt vow to
wed none but one of thine own race, his
life and liberty are thine to give. Speak,
Zara! Wilt thou do all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Oh, Father, Father, anything but
this! Pity, gratitude, and love have bound
me to him, and the fetters thou hast cast
around him are not stronger than the
deep affection he hath wakened in my
heart. Ah, why wilt thou not give life
and liberty to him, and joy to thy child?
I will not take the vow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Then his fate is sealed. Thy
girl's heart is too selfish to forego its own
joy for his sake. Thou dost not love
enough to sacrifice thy happiness to win
his freedom. I had thought more nobly
of thee, Zara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;125]</span>
<span class="smcap">Zara.</span> I <i>will</i> be worthy all thou mayst
have thought me; but thou canst little
know the desolation thou hast brought
me. Thou shalt see how deeply thou hast
wronged me, and my love. I will bear
all, suffer all, if it will win the life and
liberty of him I love so deeply and so
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Would to Heaven thou hadst
never seen this English stranger! Again,
and for the last time, Zara, I ask thee,
Wilt thou leave the captive to his fate,
and seek another heart to love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Never! I could mourn his death
with bitter tears; but oh, my love is
worthy a deeper sacrifice! He shall never
suffer one sad hour if I may spare him,
and never know that liberty to him will
bring such life-long sorrow unto me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Then thou wilt take the vow I
bid thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Then swear by all thou dost hold
most dear, and by thy mother's spirit, to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;126]</span>
wed one only of thy father's race; and
through joy and sorrow, thro' youth and
age, to keep thy vow unbroken until
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> I swear; and may the spirit of
that mother look in pity on the child
whose love hath made her life so dark
a path to tread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> May thou find comfort, Zara! I
would have spared thee this, but now it
cannot be. Yet thy reward shall well
repay thee for thy sacrifice. The English
knight is free, and thou shalt restore him
unto life and liberty. May Allah bless
thee, child!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bernardo</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> 'Tis over! The bright dream is
past. Oh, Ernest! few will love thee as I
have done; few suffer for thee all that I
so gladly bear; and none can honor thy true,
noble heart more tenderly than she whose
hard lot it is to part from thee forever.
Still amid my blighted hopes one thought
can brighten my deep sorrow,&mdash;this sacrifice<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;127]</span>
but renders me more worthy of thee,
Ernest. Now farewell, love; my poor
heart may grieve for its lost joy, and look
for comfort but in Heaven.</p>

<h3>SCENE SEVENTH.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>The cell.</i>
<span class="smcap">Ernest</span> <i>chained</i>. <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Zara</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> My lord, I seek thee with glad
tidings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> Why so pale, dear lady? Let
no care for me dim thine eye, or chase the
roses from thy cheek. I would not barter
this dark cell while thou art here for a
monarch's fairest home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Thou wilt gladly leave it when
I tell thee thy captivity is o'er, and I am
here to set thee free. I have won thy
liberty, and thou mayst fly with honor all
unstained; for here my father grants thy
pardon, and now bids thee go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> How can I thank thee for thy
tenderness and pity; how may I best show
the gratitude I owe thee for the priceless
boon of freedom thou hast this day given?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;129]</span>
<span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Nay, spare thy thanks! I have
but paid the debt I owed thee, and 'tis
but life for life. Now haste; for ere the
sunset hour thou must be beyond the
city gates, and on thy way to home and
happiness [<i>takes off his chains</i>]. And now,
brave heart, thou art free, and Zara's task
is done [<i>turns to go</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> Stay, lady! thou hast loosed
the chains that bound these hands, but
oh, thou hast cast a stronger one around
my heart; and with my liberty comes love,
and thoughts of thee, thy beauty, tenderness,
and all thou hast done for me. Lady,
thou hast cast away my fetters, but I am
captive still [<i>he kneels</i>]. Ah, listen, Zara,
while I tell thee of the love that like a
sweet flower hath blossomed in this dreary
cell, and made e'en liberty less precious
than one word, one smile from thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> I may not listen,&mdash;'tis too late,
and 'tis a sin for me to hear thee. Ah, ask
me not why, but hasten hence, and leave
me to the fate thou canst not lighten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;130]</span>
<span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> Never! I will not leave thee
till I have won the right to cheer and comfort
her who has watched so fearlessly o'er
me. Tell me all, and let me share thy
sorrow, Zara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Ah, no! It cannot be! Thou
canst not break my solemn vow. Go!
leave me! Heaven bless thee, and farewell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> A solemn vow! Hast thou
bound thyself to win my freedom? Then
never will I leave this cell till thou hast
told me all. I swear it, and I will keep
the oath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Ernest, I implore thee, fly, or it
may be too late. Thou canst not help me,
and I will not tell thee. Ah, leave me!
I cannot save thee if thou tarry now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> Never, till thou hast told me
by what noble sacrifice thou hast saved
this worthless life of mine. Let me free
thee from thy sorrow, Zara, or help thee
bear it. Thou hast won my pardon, and I
will not go till thou hast told me how.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;131]</span>
<span class="smcap">Zara.</span> And wilt thou promise to go
hence when I have told thee all, and let
me have the joy of knowing thou art
safe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> I <i>will</i> leave thee, Zara, if thou
canst bid me go. Now tell me all thy
sorrow, love, and let me share it with
thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Ernest, I sought to save thee;
for I had learned to love the noble
stranger who had done so kind a deed for
me. I sought to win my father back to
gratitude. I wept and sued in vain,&mdash;he
would not grant thy life, the boon for
which I prayed. Alone I watched above
thee, and when the warrant for thy death
was sent, I took it from his pillow and destroyed
it. Thou wast safe. My father
charged me with the deed; and when I
told him all, he bid me love no more, and
leave thee to thy fate. He bid me show
how strong my woman's heart could be,
and told me if I yet desired thy freedom,
I might win it if I took a solemn vow to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;132]</span>
wed none but of my father's race. I took
the vow, and thou art free. Ah, no
more!&mdash;and let us part while yet I have
the strength to say farewell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> And is it yet too late? Canst
thou not take back the vow, and yet be
mine? I cannot leave thee,&mdash;rather be
a captive here till thou shalt set me free.
Come, Zara, fly with me, and leave the
father who would blight thy life to satisfy
a fierce revenge. Ah, come and let me
win thee back to love and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Ernest, tempt me not. By that
sad vow I swore by all my future hopes,
and by my dead mother's spirit, I would
never listen to thy words of love. And
stern and cruel tho' my father be, I cannot
leave him now. Deep and bitter though
this sorrow be, 'tis nobler far to bear the
burden than to cast it down and seek in
idle joys to banish penitence; for thorns
would lie amid the flowers. Farewell!
Forget me, and in happy England find some
other heart to gladden with thy love. Oh,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;133]</span>
may she prove as fond and faithful as thy
Moorish Zara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest.</span> I will plead no more, nor add
to that sad heart another sorrow. I will
be worthy such true love, and though we
meet no more on earth, in all my wanderings
sweet tender thoughts of thee shall
dwell within my heart. I will bear my
sorrow as a brave man should. The life
thou hast saved and brightened by thy
love shall yet be worthy thee. Farewell!
May all the blessings a devoted
heart can give rest on thee, dearest.
Heaven bless thee, and grant that we shall
meet again.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Gone, gone, forever! Oh,
Father, couldst thou know the deep grief
and despair thy cruelty has brought two
loving hearts, thou wouldst relent, and
call them back to happiness. Where can
I look for comfort now? [<i>Weeps.</i>] I will
seek the good priest who hath so long
watched above the motherless child. I<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;134]</span>

<h3>SCENE EIGHTH.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>Cell of the priest.</i>
<span class="smcap">Hernando</span> <i>reading</i>. <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Zara</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Father, I have come for help
and counsel. Wilt thou give it now as
thou hast ever done to her who comes to
learn of thee how best to bear a sorrow
cheerfully and well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> Speak on, dear child. I know
thy sorrow. Thou hast loved, and sacrificed
thy own life's joy to win a brave
heart's freedom. Thou hast done nobly
and well; thy sorrow will but render thee
more worthy of the happiness thou hast
so truly won.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> No, no; we shall never meet
again on earth. Ah, holy father, they who
told thee of my love for one who well
might win the noblest heart, have told
thee but the lightest part of the deep grief
that bears me down. Listen to me, Father,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;136]</span>
and then give me comfort if thou canst.
To win my lover's freedom, I have sworn
a solemn oath to wed none but of my
father's race. Ernest came from sunny
England, and I am the daughter of a
Moorish lord. Alas, 'tis vain to hope!
The vow is given, and must be kept.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> Ay, Zara, and it may be kept;
but these sad tears will change to sighs
of joy when I have told thee all. Then
thou wilt bless the vow which brings thee
sorrow now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Oh, speak! Tell me what joy
canst thou give to lighten grief like mine!
Give me not too much hope; for if it fail,
despair thou canst not banish will cast a
deeper gloom o'er this poor heart. Now,
tell me all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> Calm thyself, poor child; it will
be well with thee, and thou shalt yet
blossom in thy loveliness beside the heart
thou hast won. I will tell thee the true
tale of thy fair mother's life. She loved and
wed a stranger, and thus won the hatred<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;137]</span>
of her Moorish kindred, who sought to win
her for their prince's bride. And when
she fled away with him to whom her true
heart's love was given, they vowed a fierce
revenge. Years passed away; she drooped
and died. Thy father perished bravely on
the field of battle, and left his child to me.
I stood beside thy mother's dying bed, and
vowed to guard her babe till thou wert
safe among thy Moorish kindred. I have
watched thee well, and thou art worthy all
the happiness thy true heart hath won.
Bernardo of Castile is but thy mother's
friend; thy father was an English lord,
and thou canst keep thy vow, and yet wed
the brave young Englishman who hath
won thy love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Heaven pardon this wild, wilful
heart that should mourn the sorrow sent,
when such deep joy as this is given. Ah,
Father, how can I best thank thee for the
blessed comfort thou hast given?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> Thy joy, dear child, is my reward.
When thou art safe with him thou<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;138]</span>
lovest, my task on earth is done, and I
shall pass away with happy thoughts of
the sweet flower that bloomed beside the
old man's path through life, and cheered
it with her love. Bless thee, my Zara,
and may the spirit of thy mother watch
above thee in the happy home thou hast
gained by thy noble sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Oh, Father, may the joy thy
words have brought me brighten thine
own life as they have mine. The blessings
of a happy heart be on thee. Farewell,
Father!</p>

Save thyself. Heaven bless thee.</p>

<p>Brave and true unto the last! O heart!
thou mayst well beat proudly, for thou

Ernest L'Estrange. Time flies; this night
the city is betrayed, and we must fly.<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;140]</span>
Bernardo, lord of fair Castile, is a traitor.
Ah, thank Heaven he is <i>not</i> my father!
Yet for the love I bore him as a child, he

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Seek not to deceive me. I know

traitor who will this night betray Castile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Girl, beware, lest thy wild folly
anger me too far! What meanest thou?
Who has dared to tell thee this?</p>

read the scroll, and see how well the false
king keeps his word he plighted thee for
thy deed of treachery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> [<i>reads, and drops the paper</i>]. Lost!
lost! Fool that I was to trust the promise
of a king! Disgraced, dishonored,

help me now? [<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara.</span> Here,&mdash;in the child who clings to
thee through danger, treachery, and death.
Trust to the love of one whom once thou
loved, and who still longs to win thee back
to happiness and honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Nay, child, I trust thee not. I have
deceived thee and blighted all thy hopes of
love. Thou canst not care for the dishonored
traitor. Go! tell my guilt to those
I would this night deliver up to death, and
win a deep revenge for all the wrong I
have done thee. I am in thy power now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zara</span> [<i>tearing the paper</i>]. And thus do
I use it! No eye shall ever read these
words that do betray thee; no tongue call
down dishonor on thy head. Thy plot is<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;142]</span>
not yet known, and ere to-night the gates
may be well guarded. Thou mayst fly in
safety, and none ever know the stain upon
thy name. Thou whom I once called
father, this is my revenge. I know all
the wrong thou hast done me,&mdash;the false
vow I made to save the life of him I loved.
Zara's pity and forgiveness are thine, freely
given; and her prayer is that thou mayst
find happiness in some fair land where only
gentle thoughts and loving memories may
be thine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Thou hast conquered, Zara; my
proud heart is won by thy tender pity
and most generous pardon to one who
hath so deeply wronged thee. But I will
repay the debt I owe thee. Thou shalt
find again the loving father and the faithful
friend of thy young life. Thou shalt
know how well Bernardo can atone for all
the sorrow he hath brought thee.</p>

<h2>THE GREEK SLAVE.</h2>

<h3>SCENE FIRST.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>Apartment in the palace of</i> <span class="smcap">Irene</span>.
<span class="smcap">Irene</span>, <i>reclining upon a divan.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene.</span> How strange a fate is mine!
Young, fair, and highborn, I may not
choose on whom I will bestow my love!
Betrothed to a prince whom I have never
seen; compelled to honor and obey one
whom my heart perchance can never love,
alas! alas!</p>

<p>And yet, they tell me that Constantine
is noble, brave, and good. What more
can I desire? Ah, if he do but love me
I shall be content [<i>noise without; she rises</i>].
Hark! 'tis his messenger approaching with
letters from the queen, his mother. I will
question this ambassador, and learn yet<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;150]</span>
more of this young prince, my future
husband [<i>seats herself with dignity</i>].</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rienzi</span>. <i>Kneels, presenting a letter.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rienzi.</span> The queen, my mistress, sends
thee greeting, lady, and this scroll. May
it please thee, read. I await your pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene</span> [<i>takes the letter and reads</i>]. My
lord, with a woman's curiosity, I fain would
ask thee of thy prince, whose fate the gods
have linked with mine. Tell me, is he
tender, true, and noble? Answer truly,
I do command thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rienzi.</span> Lady, he is tender as a woman,
gentle as thy heart could wish, just and
brave as a king should ever be. The
proudest lady in all Greece were well
matched with our noble Constantine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene.</span> And is he fair to look upon?
Paint me his likeness, if thou canst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rienzi.</span> I can but ill perform that
office. Thou must see if thou wouldst
rightly know him. The gods have blessed
him with a fair and stately form, a noble
face, dark locks, and a king-like brow that<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;151]</span>
well befits the crown that rests upon it.
This is he, our brave young prince; one
to honor, lady; one to trust and&mdash;love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene.</span> 'Tis a noble man thou hast
painted. One more question and thou
mayst retire. Hath he ever spoken of her
who is to be his wife? Nay, why do I
fear to ask thee? Does he love her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rienzi.</span> Lady, I beg thee ask me not.
Who could fail to love when once he had
looked upon thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene.</span> Thou canst not thus deceive
me. Answer truly: What doth he think
of this betrothal and approaching marriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rienzi.</span> He hath not seen thee, princess,
knows of thee nothing save that thou
art beautiful, and one day to become his
wife. But he is young, and hath no wish
to wed, and even his mother's prayers have
failed to win his free consent to this most
cherished plan, that by uniting thy fair
kingdom unto his, he can gain power over
other lands and beautify our own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;152]</span><span class="smcap">Irene.</span> Perchance his heart is given
to another. Has no fair Grecian maiden
won the love he cannot offer me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rienzi.</span> Nay, lady. He loves nought
but his mother, his subjects, and his native
land. But soon we trust, when thou art
by his side, a deeper love will wake within
him, and thou wilt be dearer than country,
home, or friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene.</span> 'Tis well; thou mayst retire. I
will send answer by thee to thy queen, and
seek some gift that may be worthy her
acceptance. And now, adieu! [<span class="smcap">Rienzi</span>
<i>bows and retires.</i>] He does not love me,
then, and I must wed a cold and careless
lord. And yet&mdash;so tender to all others,
he could not be unkind to me alone.</p>

<p>Oh, that I could win his love unknown,
and then when truly mine, to cast away
the mask, and be myself again. Stay!
let me think. Ah, yes; I see a way.
Surely the gods have sent the thought! I
will disguise me as a slave, and as a gift
sent to his mother, I can see and learn to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;153]</span>
know him well. I will return with the
ambassador, Rienzi. I spake to him of a
gift. He little thinks in the veiled slave
he shall bear away, the princess is concealed.
Yes, Constantine, as a nameless
girl will Irene win thy heart; and when as
a wife she stands beside thee, thou shalt
love her for herself alone.</p>

Queen.</span> Why comes he not? They
told me that our ambassador to the Princess
Irene had returned, and bore a gift
for me. Would that it were a picture of
herself! They say she is wondrous fair;
and could my wayward son but gaze upon
her, his heart might yet be won. [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Irene</span>, <i>disguised as the slave,</i> <span class="smcap">Ione</span>.] Ah, a
stranger! Who art thou?</p>

<p>
[<span class="smcap">Ione</span> <i>kneels and presents a letter.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> [<i>reads the letter</i>]. Ah, welcome!
Thy mistress tells me she hath chosen from
among her train the fairest and most faithful
of her slaves, as a gift for me. With
thanks do I accept thee. Lift thy veil,
child, that I may see how our maidens do
compare with thee. [<span class="smcap">Ione</span> <i>lifts her veil.</i>
<span class="smcap">The Queen</span> <i>gazes in surprise at her beauty.</i>]<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;155]</span>
Thou art too beautiful to be a slave.
What is thy name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Ione; may it please thee, lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen.</span> 'Tis a fit name for one so fair;
and thy country, maiden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> With the princess, my kind
mistress, have I dwelt for many happy
years; and honored by her choice now
offer my poor services to thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen.</span> What canst thou do, Ione?
Thou art too fair and delicate to bear the
heavy water-urn or gather fruit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> I can weave garlands, lady;
touch the harp, and sing sweet songs; can
bear thee wine, and tend thy flowers. I
can be true and faithful, and no task will
be too hard for thy grateful slave, Ione.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen.</span> Thou shalt find a happy home
with me, and never grieve for thy kind
mistress. And now, listen while I tell
thee what thy hardest task shall be. I
will confide in thee, Ione, for thou art no
common slave, but a true and gentle
woman whom I can trust and love. Thou<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;156]</span>
hath heard thy lady is betrothed to my
most noble son; and yet, I grieve to say,
he loves her not. Nay, in the struggle
'gainst his heart, hath lost all gayety and
strength, and even the name Irene will
chase the smile away. He loves no other,
yet will not offer her his hand when the
heart that should go with it feels no love
for her who is to be his wife. I honor
this most noble feeling; yet could he
know the beauty and the worth of thy
fair lady, he yet might love. Thou shalt
tell him this: all the kind deeds she hath
done, the gentle words she hath spoken;
all her loveliness and truth thou shalt repeat;
sing thou the songs she loved; weave
round his cups the flowers she wears; and
strive most steadfastly to gain a place within
his heart for love and Lady Irene. Canst
thou, wilt thou do this, Ione?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Dear lady, all that my poor skill
can do shall yet be tried. I will not rest
till he shall love my mistress as she longs
to be beloved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;157]</span>
<span class="smcap">Queen.</span> If thou canst win my son to
health and happiness again, thou shalt be
forever my most loved, most trusted friend.
The gods bless thee, child, and give thy
work success! Now rest thee here. I will
come ere long to lead thee to the prince.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> All goes well; and what an easy
task is mine! To minister to him whom I
already love; to sing to him, weave garlands
for his brow, and tell him of the
thoughts stirring within my heart. Yes,
I most truly long to see him whom all love
and honor. The gods be with me, and my
task will soon be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Con.</span> Another day is well-nigh passed,
and nearer draws the fate I dread. Why
must I give up all the bright dreams of
my youth, and wed a woman whom I
cannot love?</p>

<p>They tell me she is young and fair, but
I seek more than that in her who is to pass
her life beside me. Youth and beauty
fade, but a noble woman's love can never
die. Oh, Irene, if thou couldst know how
hard a thing it is to take thee, princess
though thou art! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ione</span>.] Ah,
lady, thou hast mistaken thy way! Let me
lead thee to the queen's apartments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Nay, my lord; I have come
from her. She bid me say it was her will
that I, her slave, should strive with my<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;159]</span>
poor skill to while away the time till she
could join thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Thou, a slave? By the gods! methought
it was some highborn lady,&mdash;nay,
even the Princess Irene herself, seeking
the queen, my mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> She was my mistress, and bestowed
me as a gift upon the queen. This
scroll is from her hand. May it please
thee, read it [<i>kneels and presents letter</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Rise, fair maiden! I would rather
listen to thy voice. May I ask thee to
touch yon harp? I am weary, and a gentle
strain will sooth my troubled spirit. Stay!

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Native land, native land, farewell!</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> 'Tis a plaintive song. Is it thine
own lot thou art mourning? If so, thou
art a slave no longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Nay, my lord. It was one my
Lady Irene loved, and thus I thought
would please thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Then never sing it more,&mdash;speak
not her name! Nay, forgive me if I pain
thee. She was thy mistress, and thou didst
love her. Was she kind to thee? By
what name shall I call thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Ione, your Highness. Ah, yes;
she was too kind. She never spake a cruel
word, nor chid me for my many faults.<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;161]</span>
Never can I love another as I loved my
gentle mistress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> And is she very fair? Has she no
pride, no passion or disdain to mar her
loveliness? She is a princess; is she a
true and tender woman too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Though a princess, 'neath her
royal robes there beats a warm, true heart,
faithful and fond, longing to be beloved
and seeking to be worthy such great joy
when it shall come. Thou ask'st me of her
beauty. Painters place her face among
their fairest works, and sculptors carve her
form in marble. Yes, she is beautiful;
but 'tis not that thou wouldst most care
for. Couldst thou only know her!&mdash;pardon,
but I think thou couldst not bear
so cold a heart within thy breast as
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Ah, do not cease! say on! There
is that in the music of thy voice that
soothes and comforts me. Come, sit beside
me, fair Ione, and I will tell thee why
I do not love thy princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>

slave; I will kneel here.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Prince reclines upon a couch.</i> <span class="smcap">Ione</span> <i>kneels
beside him.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Listen! From a boy I have been
alone; no loving sister had I, no gentle
friend,&mdash;only cold councillors or humble
slaves. My mother was a queen, and 'mid
the cares of State, tho' fondly loving me,
her only son, could find no time to win me
from my lonely life.</p>

<p>Thus, tho' dwelling 'neath a palace roof
with every wish supplied, I longed most
fondly for a friend. And now, ere long,
a crown will rest upon my head, a nation
bend before me as their king. And now
more earnestly than ever do I seek one
who can share with me the joys and cares
of my high lot,&mdash;a woman true and noble,
to bless me with her love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> And could not the Princess
Irene be to thee all thou hast dreamed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> I fear I cannot love her. They
told me she was beautiful and highborn;<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;163]</span>
and when I sought to learn yet more, 'twas
but to find she was a cold, proud woman,
fit to be a queen, but not a loving wife.
Thus I learned to dread the hour when I
must wed. Yet 'tis my mother's will; my
country's welfare calls for the sacrifice, and
I must yield myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> They who told thee she was
proud and cold do all speak falsely. Proud
she is to those who bow before her but to
gain some honor for themselves, and cold
to such as love her for her royalty alone.
But if a fond and faithful heart, and a soul
that finds its happiness in noble deeds can
make a queen, Irene is worthy of the
crown she will wear. And now, if it
please thee, I will seek the garden; for
thy mother bid me gather flowers for the
feast. Adieu, my lord! [<i>She bows, her
veil falls</i>; <span class="smcap">Constantine</span> <i>hands it to her.</i>]
Nay, kings should not bend to serve a
slave, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> I do forget myself most strangely.
There, take thy veil, and leave me [<i>turns</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;164]</span>

but I cannot treat thee as a slave. Come,

Ione.</span> The rose is Love's own flower,
and I will place it in the wreath I weave
for thee, O Constantine! Would I could
bring it to thy heart as easily! And yet,
methinks, if all goes on as now, the slave
Ione will ere long win a prince's love. He
smiles when I approach, and sighs when I
would leave him; listens to my songs, and
saves the withered flowers I gave him days
ago. How gentle and how kind! Ah,
noble Constantine, thou little thinkest the
slave thou art smiling on is the "proud,
cold" Princess Irene, who will one day
show thee what a fond, true wife she will
be to thee [<i>sings</i>].</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Helon</span>; <i>kneels to</i> <span class="smcap">Ione</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Helon, my father's friend! thou
here! Ah, hush! Betray me not! I am no<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;166]</span>
princess now. Rise, I do beseech thee!
Kneel not to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helon.</span> Dear lady, why this secrecy?
What dost thou here, disguised, in the
palace where thou art soon to reign a
queen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Hark! is all still? Yes; none
are nigh! Speak low. I'll tell thee all.
Thou knowest the young prince loves me
not,&mdash;nay, do not sigh; I mean the
princess, not the slave Ione, as I now call
myself. Well, I learned this, and vowed
to win the heart he could not give; and so
in this slave's dress I journeyed hither with
Rienzi, the ambassador, as a gift unto the
queen.</p>

<p>Thus, as a poor and nameless slave, I
seek to win the noble Constantine to life
and love. Dost understand my plot, and
wilt thou aid me, Father Helon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helon.</span> 'Tis a strange thought! None
but a woman would have planned it. Yes,
my child, I will aid thee, and thou yet
shall gain the happiness thy true heart<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;167]</span>
well deserves. We will talk of this yet
more anon. I came hither to see the
prince. They told me he was pale and ill,
in sorrow for his hated lot. Say, is this so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Ah, yes, most true; and I am
cause of all this sorrow. Father, tell me,
cannot I by some great deed give back his
health, and never have the grief of knowing
that he suffered because I was his
bride? How can I avert this fate? I will
do all, bear all, if he may be saved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helon.</span> Grieve not, my child; he will
live, and learn to love thee fondly. The
cares of a kingdom are too much for one
so young; but he would have happiness
throughout his native land, and toiling for
the good of others he hath hidden his
sorrow in his own heart, and pined for
tenderness and love. Thou hast asked
if thou couldst save him. There is one
hope, if thou canst find a brave friend
that fears no danger when a good work
leads him on. Listen, my daughter! In
a deep and lonely glen, far beyond the<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;168]</span>
palace gates, there grows an herb whose
magic power 'tis said brings new life and
strength to those who wreathe it round
their head in slumber. Yet none dare
seek the spot, for spirits are said to haunt
the glen, and not a slave in all the palace
but grows pale at mention of the place.
I am old and feeble, or I had been there
long ere this. And now, my child, who
canst thou send?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> I will send one who fears not
spirit or demon; one who will gladly risk
e'en life itself for the brave young prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helon.</span> Blessed be the hand that
gathers, thrice blessed be he who dares
the dangers of the way. Bring hither
him thou speakest of. I would see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> She stands before thee. Nay,
start not, Father. <i>I</i> will seek the dreaded
glen and gather there the magic flowers
that may bring health to Constantine and
happiness to me. I will away; bless, and
let me go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helon.</span> Thou, a woman delicate and<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;169]</span>
fair! Nay, nay, it must not be, my child!
Better he should die than thou shouldst
come to harm. I cannot let thee go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Thou canst not keep me now.
Thou hast forgot I am a slave, and none
may guess beneath this veil a princess is
concealed. I will take my water-urn, and
with the other slaves pass to the spring
beyond the city gates; then glide unseen
into the haunted glen. Now, tell me how
looks the herb, that I may know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helon.</span> 'Tis a small, green plant that
blossoms only by the broad, dark stream,
dashing among the rocks that fill the glen.
But let me once again implore thee not to
go. Ah, fatal hour when first I told thee!
'Tis sending thee to thy death! Stay,
stay, my child, or let me go with thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> It cannot be; do thou remain,
and if I come not back ere set of sun, do

I loved him, and so farewell. I

snow-white arm that bore the water-urn.
The morning sun shone brightly on the
golden hair, and seemed more beautiful
for resting there; and now 'tis nearly
set, and yet she comes not. Why should I
grieve because my mother's slave forgets
me? Shame on thee, Constantine! How
weak and childish have I grown! This fever
gives no rest when Ione is not here to sing
sweet songs, and cheer the weary hours.
Ah, she comes! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ione</span> <i>with basket of
flowers.</i>] Where hast thou been, Ione?
The long day passed so slowly, and I<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;172]</span>
missed thee sadly from my side. But
thou art pale; thy locks are damp! What
has chanced to thee? Speak, I beseech
thee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> 'Tis nothing; calm thyself, my
lord. I am well, and bring thee from the
haunted glen the magic flowers whose
power I trust will win thee health and
happiness. May it please thee to accept
them [<i>kneels, and gives the flowers</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Thou, thou, Ione? Hast thou
been to that fearful spot, where mortal
foot hath feared to tread? The gods

can I thank thee? Ah, why didst thou
risk so much for my poor life? It were
not worth the saving if thine were
lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> My lord, a loving nation looks to
thee for safety and protection. I am but
a feeble woman, and none would grieve if
I were gone; none weep for the friendless
slave, Ione.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Oh, say not thus! Tears would<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;173]</span>
be shed for thee, and one heart would
grieve for her who risked so much for him.
Speak not of death or separation, for I
cannot let thee go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> I will not leave thee yet, till I
have won thy lost health back. The old
priest, Helon, bid me seek the herbs, and
bind them in a garland for thy brow. If
thou wilt place it there, and rest awhile, I
am repaid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> If thy hand gave it, were it
deadly poison I would place it there.
Now sing, Ione; thy low sweet voice

healing sleep will be the deeper with thy
music sounding in mine ears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Queen.</span> 'Tis strange what power this
slave hath gained o'er Constantine. She
hath won him back to health again, and
never have I seen so gay a smile upon his
lips as when she stood beside him in the
moonlight singing to her harp. And yet,
tho' well and strong again, he takes no
interest in his native land. He comes no
more to council hall or feast, but wanders
'mong his flowers with Ione. How can I
rouse him to the danger that is near!
The Turkish sultan and his troops are on
their way to conquer Greece, and he, my
Constantine, who should be arming for the
fight, sits weaving garlands with the lovely
slave girl! Ah, a thought hath seized me!
Why cannot she who hath such power o'er
him rouse up with noble words the brave<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;176]</span>
heart slumbering in his breast? I hear
her light step in the hall. Ione, Ione,&mdash;come
hither! I would speak with thee.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ione</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Your pleasure, dearest lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen.</span> Ione, thou knowest how I love
thee for the brave deeds thou hast done.
Thou hast given health unto my son, hath
won him back to happiness. Thou hast
conquered his aversion to the princess, and
he will gladly wed her when the hour shall
come. Is it not so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Dear lady, that I cannot tell
thee. He never breathes her name, and
if I speak of her as thou hast bid me, he
but sighs, and grows more sad; and yet
I trust, nay, I well know that when he
sees her he will gladly give his hand to
one who loves him as the princess will.
Then do not grieve, but tell thy slave how
she may serve thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen.</span> Oh, Ione, if thou couldst wake
him from the quiet dream that seems to
lie upon his heart. His country is in<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;177]</span>
danger, and he should be here to counsel
and command. Go, tell him this in thine
own gentle words; rouse him to his duty,
and thou shalt see how brave a heart is
there. Thou hast a wondrous power to
sadden or to cheer. Oh, use it well, and
win me back my noble Constantine! Canst
thou do this, Ione?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> I will; and strive most earnestly
to do thy bidding. But of what danger
didst thou speak? No harm to him, I trust?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen.</span> The Turkish troops are now on
their way to carry woe and desolation into
Greece, and he, the prince, hath taken no
part in the councils. His nobles mourn at
his strange indifference, and yet he heeds
them not.</p>

<p>I know not why, but some new happiness
hath come to him, and all else is
forgot. But time is passing. I will leave
thee to thy work, and if thou art successful,
thou wilt have won a queen's most
fervent gratitude. Adieu, my child!</p>

thine eye, Ione, the bright glow to thy
cheek? What mean these arms? Wouldst
thou go forth to meet the Turks? Thy<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;180]</span>
beauty would subdue them sooner than
the sword thou art gazing on so earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Thou hast bade me speak, my
lord, and I obey; but pardon thy slave if
in her wish to serve she seem too bold.
Thy mother and thy subjects wonder at
thy seeming indifference when enemies
are nigh. Thine army waits for thee to
lead them forth; thy councillors sit silent,
for their prince is gone. While grief and
terror reign around, he is wandering 'mong
his flowers, or listening to the music of his
harp. Ah, why is this? What hath befallen
thee? Thou art no longer pale
and feeble, yet there seems a spell set on
thee. Ah, cast it off, and show them that
thou hast no fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> I am no coward, Ione; but there
is a spell upon me. 'Tis a holy one, and
the chain that holds me here I cannot
break,&mdash;for it is <i>love</i>. I have lost the
joy I once took in my subjects and my
native land, and am content to sit beside
thee, and listen to the music of thy voice.<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;181]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Then let that voice arouse thee.
Oh, fling away the chain that keeps thee
from thy duty, and be again the noble
prince who thought but of his people.
Oh, let me plead for those who sorrow for
thy care, and here let me implore thee to
awaken from thy dream and be thyself
again [<i>she kneels</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Oh, not to me! Rise, I beseech
thee, rise! Thou hast led me to my duty;
I will obey thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> I would have thee gird on thy
sword, and with shield upon thine arm,
and banner in thy hand, go forth and
conquer like a king. Show those who
doubt thee that their fears are false,&mdash;that
thou art worthy of their love. Lead forth
thy troops, and save thy country from the
woe that now draws nigh. Victory surely
will be theirs when thou shalt lead them
on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Give me my sword, unfurl my
banner, and say farewell. I will return
victorious, or no more. Thy voice hath<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;182]</span>
roused me from my idle but most lovely
dream, and thy brave words shall cheer
me on till I have won the honor of my
people back. Pity and forgive my fault;

who so passionately loves thee. Farewell!

the brave unknown who led on my slaves,
and saved us when all hope seemed gone.
Who could have been the fearless stranger?
Like an avenging spirit came the mysterious
leader, carrying terror and destruction
to the Turkish ranks. My brave
troops rallied and we won the day. Yet
when I sought him, he was gone, and none
could tell me where. He hath won my
deepest gratitude, and the honor of all
Greece for this brave deed.</p>

<p>But where is Ione? Why comes she not
to bid me welcome home? Ah, could she
know that thoughts of her gave courage
to my heart, and strength to my weak<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;185]</span>
arm, and led me on that I might be

Thou art pale and faint, Ione,&mdash;lean thus
on me.</p>

to thee. Go, I pray thee, go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Not till thou hast pardoned me.
I have made thee weep, and every tear
that falls reproaches me for my rash words.
Forget them, and forgive me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;187]</span>
<span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Ask not forgiveness of thy slave,
my lord. 'Tis I who have offended.
And think not thus of Lady Irene, who
in her distant home hath cherished tender
thoughts of one whom all so honored.
Think of her grief when she shall find
thee cold and careless, and shall learn that
he who should most love and cherish,
deems her but a burden, and hates the
wife whom he hath vowed to wed. Ah,
think of this, and smile no more upon
the slave who may not listen to her lord.</p>

obey thee, and seek to hide my sorrow
within my lonely breast. Teach me to
love thy mistress as I ought, and I will
sacrifice each selfish wish, and be more
worthy thy forgiveness, and a little place
within thy heart. Trust me, I will speak
no more of my unhappy love, and will
seek thee only when thine own voice bids
me come.</p>

<p>The sunlight of thy presence is my
truest joy, and banishment from thee the<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;188]</span>
punishment my wilful heart deserves.
Rest here, Ione, and weep for me no more.
I am happy if thou wilt but smile again.

thee! [<i>Kisses her robe, and rushes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Ione.</span> How desolate and dreary all hath
grown! The garden once so bright hath
lost its beauty now, for Constantine no
longer walks beside me. The palace
rooms seem sad and lonely, for his voice
no longer echoes there, and the music of
his harp is never heard. His pale face
haunts me through all my waking hours,
and his mournful eyes look on me in my
dreams. But soon his sorrow all shall
cease, for nearer draws the day when Princess
Irene comes to claim the heart so
hardly won, and will by constancy and love
so faithfully reward. Hark! I hear a step.
It is Rienzi. How shall I escape,&mdash;my
veil is in the garden! He knows me and<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;190]</span>
will discover all. Stay! this curtain shall
conceal me [<i>hides within the drapery</i>].</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rienzi</span> <i>stealthily.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rienzi.</span> How! not here? I told the
messenger to meet me in the gallery that
leads from the garden. Curses on him!
he hath delayed, and were I discovered in
this part of the palace, all might be betrayed.
I'll wait, and if he comes not,
I'll bear the message to the friends myself,
and tell the bold conspirators we meet to-night
near the haunted glen, to lay yet
farther plans. We must rid the kingdom
of the prince, who will be made ere long
our king, for his bridal with the Princess
Irene draws more near. But ere the royal
crown shall rest upon his brow, that head
shall be laid low. The queen will soon
follow her young son, and then we'll seize
the kingdom and rule it as we will. Hark!
methought I heard a sound. I may be
watched. I'll stay no longer, but seek
the place myself [<i>steals out and disappears

thee from the danger that surrounds thee.
I will haste to tell him all I have discovered.
Yet, no! Rienzi may escape, and
I can charge none other with the crime.
They meet near the haunted glen, and
not a slave would follow even his brave
prince to that dark spot. How can I aid
him to discover those who seek to do him
harm? Stay! I will go alone. Once have
I dared the dangers of the way to save
thy life, Constantine; again I'll tread the
fearful path, and watch the traitors at their
evil work. It shall be done! I will dare
all, and fail not, falter not, till thou who art

she twined them for my brow. Those
happy days are passed; she comes no

And yet 'tis better so. The princess

thy life. Rienzi, and a band of other
traitors, seek to win thy throne and take
the life of their kind prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> It cannot be, Ione! They could
not raise their hands 'gainst one who hath
striven for their good. They cannot wish
the life I would so gladly have lain down<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;196]</span>
to save them. Who told thee this, Ione?
I cannot&mdash;no, I will not think they could
prove so ungrateful unto their prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> I cannot doubt the truth of this,
my lord, for one whose word I trust learned
it, and followed to the haunted glen, there
saw Rienzi, whose guilty conscience drove
him from the place, leaving behind this
scroll whereon are all the traitors' names.
And this dagger,&mdash;'tis his own, as thou
mayst see [<i>shows dagger and scroll</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> I can no longer doubt; but I
had rather have felt the dagger in my

the name of thy brave friend who hath
discovered this deep treason, and let me
offer some reward to one who hath watched
above me with such faithful care.</p>

<span class="smcap">Con.</span> Thou canst not thus deceive me.
It was thine own true heart that dared so
much to save my life. Oh, Ione, why wilt
thou make me love thee more by deeds
like these,&mdash;why make the sorrow heavier
to bear, the parting sadder still?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Thou dost forget, my lord, I

thy voice while yet I may.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> She bid me tell thee that to-morrow,
ere the sun shall set, the Princess
Irene will be here. [<span class="smcap">Constantine</span> <i>starts
and turns aside.</i>] Forgive me that I pain
thee, but I must obey. Yet, farther: thy
bride hath sent her statue as a gift to thee,
and thou wilt find it in the queen's pavilion.
She bid me say she prayed thee to
go look upon it, and remember there thy
solemn vow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Oh, Ione, could she send none
but thee to tell me this? To hear it from<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;198]</span>
thy lips but makes the tidings heavier to
bear. Canst thou bid me go, and vow to
love one whom I have learned to hate?
Canst thou bid me leave thee for a fate
like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> My lord, thou art soon to be a
king; then for thy country's sake, remember
thy hand is plighted to the princess,
and let no kindly thoughts of a
humble slave keep thy heart from its
solemn duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> I am no king,&mdash;'tis I who am
the slave, and thou, Ione, are more to me
than country, home, or friends. Nay, do
not turn away,&mdash;think only of the love I
bear thee, and listen to my prayer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> I must not listen. Hast thou so
soon forgot the vow thou made that no
word of love should pass thy lips? Remember,
'tis a slave who stands before
thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Once more thou shalt listen to
me, Ione, and then I will be still forever.
Thou shalt be my judge, thy lips <i>shall</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;199]</span>
speak my fate. I cannot love the princess.
Wouldst thou bid me vow to cherish
her while my heart is wholly thine?
Wouldst thou ask me to pass through life
beside her with a false vow on my lips,
and, with words of love I do not feel, conceal
from her the grief of my divided
heart? Must I give up all the bright
dreams of a happier lot, and feel that life
is but a bitter struggle, a ceaseless longing
but for thee? Rather bid me to forget
the princess and bind with Love's sweet
chains the slave unto my side,&mdash;my bride
forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> The <i>slave</i> Ione can never be thy
bride, and thou art bound by solemn vows
to wed the Princess Irene. My duty
and thine honor are more precious than a
poor slave's love. Banish all thoughts of
her, and prove thyself a faithful lord unto
the wife who comes now trustingly to thee.
Ask thine own heart if life could be a
bitter pilgrimage, when a sacrifice like this
had been so nobly made. A tender wife<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;200]</span>
beside thee, a mother's blessing on thy
head,&mdash;oh, were not this a happier fate
than to enjoy a short, bright dream of
love, but to awake and find thy heart's
peace gone, thy happiness forever fled;
to see the eyes that once looked reverently
upon thee now turned aside, and
lips that spoke but tender words now
whisper scornfully of broken vows thou
wert not brave enough to keep. Forgive
me, but I cannot see the prince so false
to his own noble heart. Cast off this spell;
forget me, and Irene shall win thee back
to happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Never! All her loveliness can
never banish the pure, undying love I bear
to thee. Oh, Ione, canst thou doubt its
truth, when I obey thee now and prove
how great thy power o'er my heart hath
grown? Oh, let the sacrifice win from
<i>thee</i> one gentle thought, one kind remembrance
of him whose life thou hast made
so beautiful for a short hour. And in my
loneliness, sweet memories of thee shall<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;201]</span>
cheer and gladden, and I will bear all for
thy dear sake. And now farewell. Forgive
if I have grieved thee, and at parting
grant me one token to the silent love that
henceforth must lie unseen within my
heart. Farewell, Ione! [<i>He kisses her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione</span> [<i>falling at his feet</i>]. Ah, forgive
me,&mdash;here let me seek thy pardon for the
grief I have brought thee. May all the
happiness that earth can bring be ever
thine. But, if all others should forsake
thee, in thine hour of sorrow remember
there is one true heart that cannot change.
Oh, may the gods bless thee! 'Tis my
last wish, last prayer [<i>weeps</i>]. Farewell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Stay! I would claim from thee
one little word which hath the power to
brighten e'en my sorrow. I have never
asked thee, for I thought my heart had
read it in thine eyes that looked so kindly
on me; in the lips that spoke such gentle
words of hope. But ah! tell me now at
parting dost thou <i>love</i> me, dear Ione?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> I do, most fondly, truly love thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;202]</span>
<span class="smcap">Con.</span> Ione, thy voice hath been a holy
spell to win me to my duty. Thy love
shall keep me pure and faithful, till we
meet above. Farewell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Farewell!&mdash;and oh, remember
how I have loved thee; and may the
memory of all I have borne for thee win
thy pardon for any wrong I may have
done thee. The princess will repay the
grief the slave hath caused thy noble
heart. Remember Ione, and be true.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Gone, gone, now lost to me forever!
Remember thee! Ah, how can I
ever banish thy dear image from this heart
that now hath grown so desolate? I will
be true. None shall ever know how hard a
struggle hath been mine, that I might still
be worthy thee. Yes, Irene, I will strive
to love thee, and may the gods give me
strength; but Ione, Ione, how can I give thee
up! [<i>Picks up a flower</i> <span class="smcap">Ione</span> <i>has dropped,

<h3>SCENE THIRTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">The Queen's</span> <i>pavilion. A dark curtain
hangs before an alcove. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Constantine</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Con.</span> The hour hath come when I shall
gaze upon the form of her who hath cast
so dark a shadow o'er my life. Beautiful
and young, and blessed with all that makes
her worthy to be loved, and yet I fear I
have not taught my wilful heart the tenderness
I ought.</p>

<p>I fear to draw aside the veil that hides
her from me, for I cannot banish the sweet
image that forever floats before mine eyes.
Ione's soft gaze is on me, and the lips are
whispering, "I love thee!" But I have
promised to be true,&mdash;no thoughts of her
must lead me now astray. My fate is here
[<i>approaches the curtain</i>]. Let me gaze upon<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;204]</span>
it, and think gently of the wife so soon to
be mine own. Why do I fear? Courage,
my heart! [<i>He draws aside the curtain, and</i>
<span class="smcap">Ione</span>, <i>veiled, appears as a statue upon its
pedestal.</i>] Another veil to raise! How
hard the simple deed hath grown. One
last sweet thought of thee, Ione, and then
I will no longer falter. [<i>He turns away and
bows his head.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ione.</span> Constantine! [<i>He starts, and
gazes in wonder as the statue, casting aside the
veil, comes down and kneels.</i>] Here at thy
feet kneels thy hated bride,&mdash;the "proud,
cold princess," asking thee to pardon all
the sorrow she hath given thee. Ah, smile
upon me, and forget Ione, who as a slave
hath won thy love, but as the princess
will repay it,&mdash;forgive, and love me
still!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Thou, thou Irene,&mdash;she whom
I so feared to look upon? Ah, no!&mdash;thou
art Ione, the gentle slave. Say
am I dreaming? Why art thou here to
make another parting the harder to be<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;205]</span>
borne? Fling by thy crown and be Ione
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene</span> [<i>rising</i>]. Listen, Constantine, and
I will tell thee all. I am Irene. In my
distant home I learned thou didst not love
me, and I vowed to win thy heart before
I claimed it. Thus, unknown, the proud
princess served thee as a slave, and learned
to love thee with a woman's fondest faith.
I watched above thee that no harm should
fall; I cheered and gladdened life for thee,
and won the heart I longed for. I knew
the sorrow thou wouldst feel, but tried thy
faith by asking thee to sacrifice thy love
and keep thine honor stainless. Here let
me offer up a woman's fondest trust and
most undying love. Wilt thou believe,
and pardon mine offence? [<i>Kneels again
before him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Con.</span> Not at my feet, Irene!&mdash;'tis I
who should bend low before thee, asking
thy forgiveness. For all thou hast dared
for me; for every fearless deed; for every
loving thought, all I can lay before thee is<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;206]</span>
a fond and faithful heart, whose reverence
and love can never die, but through the
pilgrimage of life shall be as true and
tender as when I gave it to the slave
Ione [<i>embraces</i> <span class="smcap">Irene</span>].</p>

<h3>SCENE FIRST.</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>Room in the palace of</i> <span class="smcap">Cleon</span>.
<span class="smcap">Iantha</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adrastus</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Iantha.</span> How wearily the days wear
on, and the heavy hours so fraught with
doubt press like death upon my aching
heart. To the young, the fair, the happy,
life is a blissful dream, filled with bright
joys; for hope like a star beams on their
pathway. But to the grief-worn heart,
worn with weary watching, vexed with
sad cares, whose hours are filled with fear,
and ever thronging sorrows, whose star
burns with a dim uncertain light,&mdash;oh,
weary, weary is the pilgrimage; joyless
the present, dark the future; and the
sooner all is o'er, the better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;212]</span><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> Daughter, thou hast forgot.
The radiant star may pale and fade, but
He who giveth it its light still liveth.
Turn unto Him thy worn and bleeding
heart, and comfortless thou shalt not
be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> Father, I cannot. When I
would pray for resignation, words fail me,
and my soul is filled with murmuring, while
round me throng visions of battle-fields
and death. Ever comes before me the
form of Cleon,&mdash;no longer bright and
beautiful as when, burning with hope and
confidence in his high calling, he went
forth to conquer or to die; but fallen,
bleeding, perhaps dead, or a captive in
the dungeon of the pagan, doomed to
waste in hopeless misery the long years
of his manhood. And my boy,&mdash;what
will be his fate? Father, can I think on
this and pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> 'Tis hard, Iantha; but to
His aid alone canst thou look up to save
thy husband from the horrors of a bloody<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;213]</span>
war. Call on Him, and He, the merciful,
will in thy great need be near thee.</p>

<p>
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Medon</span>.<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Medon.</span> A stranger craveth audience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha</span> [<i>rushing forward</i>]. A stranger!
Cometh he from my lord?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medon.</span> I know not, lady; but as a
messenger is he clad, and with great haste
demandeth speech of thee, saying he bore
tidings of great import.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> Admit him instantly. [<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smcap">Medon</span>.] Father, do thou follow, and
speed him hither.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> I hasten to obey thee.
Bear a brave heart, my daughter. I feel
that hope is near.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Adrastus</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha</span> [<i>joyfully</i>]. Hope,&mdash;thrice blessed
word!&mdash;wilt thou indeed visit this doubting
heart once more, and sweeten the cup
thou hast so long forsaken? [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hafiz</span>.]
Welcome! comest thou from my lord?
Thy tidings speedily!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hafiz.</span> To the wife of Cleon, late commander<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;214]</span>
of the rebel Greeks, am I sent to
bear tidings of their defeat by Mohammed,
now master of all Greece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> And my lord,&mdash;the noble
Cleon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hafiz.</span> Betrayed, defeated, and now
lying under sentence of immediate death
in the dungeon of the Sultan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> Lost! lost! lost! [<i>Falls fainting

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adrastus</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> Daughter, look up!&mdash;there

heart and cast off this spell. And
thou, slave, hence,&mdash;away!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hafiz</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha</span> [<i>rousing</i>]. Defeated, imprisoned,
condemned,&mdash;words unto one heart
fraught with such dire despair. Tell me,
Father, oh, tell me truly, do I dream?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ion</span>, <i>who stands listening.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> 'Tis no dream. The rough
soldier did but tell thee in rude speech,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;215]</span>
what I was hastening in more guarded
words to bear thee. 'Tis true; thy lord is
in Mohammed's power, a victim to the perfidy
of pagans, and doomed unto a speedy
death. Nay, Iantha, shrink not, but as a
soldier's wife, glory in the death of thy brave
knight, dying for his country; and in his
martyrdom take to thy soul sweet comfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> Comfort! Oh, man, thou
little knowest woman's heart! What to
her is glory, when him she loveth is torn
from her forever? What to the orphan is
the crown of martyrdom, the hero's fame,
the praise of nations, the homage of the
great? Will they give back the noble
dead, heal the broken heart, tear bitter
memories from the wounded soul to whom
earth is desolate? Nay, Father, nay. Oh,
Cleon, would I could die with thee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> This mighty sorrow o'erpowers
her reason and will destroy all
hope. Iantha, daughter, rouse thyself;
let the love thou dost bear thy lord now
aid in his deliverance. From the wealth<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;216]</span>
of thy heart's true affection, devise thou
some way to save him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> Aid me, Father; I have no
power of thought. I will trust all to <i>thee</i>.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Ion</span> <i>approaches.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> I know not what to counsel
thee; my life hath ill fitted me to deal
with soldiers and with kings. But if some
messenger&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> Nay, it will not serve. None
will dare brave the anger of the pagan,
and death were the doom of such as
approach him other than as a slave. And
yet,&mdash;perchance he might relent. Oh,
were there some true heart, fearless and
loving, to aid me now in mine hour of
distress! Where can I look for help?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion</span> [<i>coming forward</i>]. Here, Mother,&mdash;<i>I</i>
will seek the camp of Mohammed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> Thou!&mdash;my Ion, my only
one. No, no; it may not be,&mdash;thy tender
youth, thy gentle, untried spirit. 'Tis
madness e'en to think on!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Mother, am I not a soldier's son,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;217]</span>
cradled 'mid warriors? Runs not the blood
of heroes in these veins? Are not my
father's deeds, his bright, untarnished
name, my proud inheritance? What
though this tender form is yet untried;
what though these arms have never borne
the knightly armor? No victor's laurels rest
on this youthful brow, and I bear no honored
name among the great and glorious
of our land; yet, Mother, have I not a
father, for whose dear sake I may yet purchase
that knighthood for which this young
heart glows? Am I not the son of Cleon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> Verily doth a spirit move
the boy. Look on him now, Iantha, and
let no weak, unworthy doubt of thine curb
the proud spirit that proves him worthy of
his sire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> My son, my fair, young Ion,
thou art all now left my widowed heart.
How can I bid thee go! The barbarous
pagan will doom thee to a cruel death.
How canst thou, an unknown youth, move
the fierce heart that hath slain thy sire?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;218]</span>
<span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Fear not, Mother; he who calls
me to this glorious mission will protect
me. Shall I stand weeping while my
father still breathes the air of pagan dungeons;
while the base fetters of the infidel
rest on his limbs, and his brave followers
lie unavenged in their cold, bloody graves;
while my country's banner, torn, dishonored,
is trampled in the dust,&mdash;and he the
proud, the brave, till now unconquered
defender of that country's honor, lies
doomed to an ignominious death? Oh,
Mother, bid me go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrastus.</span> Iantha, speak to the boy!
Let him not say his <i>mother</i> taught him
fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha.</span> My Ion, go,&mdash;strong in thine
innocence and faith, go forth upon thy
holy mission; and surely He who looketh
ever with a loving face on those who put
their trust in Him, will in His mercy
guard and guide thee [<i>girds on his sword</i>].
Farewell! Go,&mdash;with thy mother's blessing
on thee!<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;219]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Now is my heart filled all anew
with hope and courage, and I go forth
trustingly. Father, thy blessing [<i>kneels

Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iantha</span> [<i>pressing</i> <span class="smcap">Ion</span> <i>to her breast</i>].
Farewell, my Ion. And if the great
Father wills it that I look not again on
thee in life, into His care do I commit
thee. Farewell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Mother, farewell! And if I fall,
mourn not, but glory that I died as best
became the son of Cleon [<i>draws his sword</i>].
And now leap forth, my sword!&mdash;henceforth
is there no rest nor honor till we
have conquered. Father, I come, I come!

<p><span class="smcap">
Moh'd.</span> And spake they no word of ransom
or of hostage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hafiz.</span> None, sire. The lady lay as
one struck dead; and the priest, foul
Christian dog, bade me go hence, and
tarry not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> And held you no speech with
those about the princess. Sure, there were
some to listen to thy master's word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hafiz.</span> Great master, I sought in vain
to set before them the royal will. At first
it were as though a spell had fallen on
them. Nay, some did turn aside and
weep, rending their hair, as though all
hope were lost. Then, when I strove to
win them to some counsel, they woke to
such an uproar, cursing thy perfidy, and
vowing most dire and speedy vengeance<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;221]</span>
on thee, clashing their weapons and crying,
"Down with the pagan dogs!" Then,
drawing forth their lances with fierce
oaths, they drove me from the gates in
such warlike manner, I could but strive
with haste to make good mine escape, and
without rest have I journeyed hither to
bring thee tidings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> By the prophet! and is it thus
they serve the royal messenger. But they
shall rue it dearly. Cleon shall die. To-morrow's
sun shall never shine for him.
The proud Greeks shall learn to dread
Mohammed's ire, and bend their haughty
heads before him in the dust. I offer
ransom, and they will not harken. I send
them honorable terms, and they thrust my
messenger rudely from their gates. They
have dared to brave me,&mdash;they shall feel
my power!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hafiz.</span> Mighty Mohammed, if thy poor
slave might offer counsel, were it not wise
to tarry till the Greeks on cooler thought
shall seek thee with some treaty which<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;222]</span>
may avail thee better than such hasty vengeance.
How much more worthy were a
heavy ransom than the life of a single
miserable prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> Peace, slave! I have said
Cleon shall die, and, by Allah! so I have
not word from these rebel dogs ere three
days shall wear away, his body swung from
the battlements shall bear them tidings of
Mohammed's power. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Selim.</span>] What
hath befallen, Selim, that thou comest in
such haste?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selim.</span> Most mighty king, there waits

thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> A youth! Who may he be,

<p><span class="smcap">Selim.</span> Most gracious sire, I know not.
Our guard surprised him wandering without

led him hither to await thy royal will.
He doth refuse all question, demanding to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;223]</span>

his errand.</p>

Hence,&mdash;bring him hither! [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Selim</span>.]
By Allah! my proud foes have deigned to
send us messengers, and seek to win the

will sue in vain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> On yonder plain, cold in their

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> Hast thou brought ransom?
Where is thy gold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> In the coffers of the Turkish

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> 'Tis here,&mdash;the son of Cleon.</p>

blood and slaves and gold? By Allah!
boy, thou must name a higher price to
win the life thou doth seek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> I have nought else to offer. Thy

any worth to thee, if these arms may toil

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> I will serve thee as a slave;
in all things do thy bidding,&mdash;faithful,
unwearied, unrepining. Grant but my

Mohammed, let me not plead in vain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> Peace, I say; anger me not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> O king, hast thou no heart?
Think of the ruined home, the mourning
people, the land made desolate by thee;
of her who now counts the weary hours
for tidings of those dear to her,&mdash;tidings
fraught with life or death as thou shalt
decree; of the son by thee doomed to
see his honored sire, hero of a hundred
battles dragged like a slave unto a shameful
death. As thou wilt have mercy
shown to thee, that mercy show thou
unto me. Oh, say to me, "Thy father
lives!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> Away! I will not listen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Nay, I <i>will</i> kneel to thee. I who
never knelt to man before, now implore
thee with earnest supplication. 'Tis for a
father's life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> Kneel not to me,&mdash;it is in
vain. Thy father is my captive, my deadliest
foe, whom I hate, and curse,&mdash;ay,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;227]</span>
and will slay. Boy, dost thou know to
whom thou dost bow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion</span> [<i>rising proudly</i>]. To the pagan Mohammed,&mdash;he
who with murderous hand
hath bathed in blood the smiling plains of
Greece; profaned her altars, enslaved her
people, and filled the land with widows'
tears and orphans' cries; he who by perfidy
makes captives of his foes, refusing
hostage and scorning honorable treaty;
turns from all supplicants, closes his heart
to mercy, and tramples under foot all pity
and all justice,&mdash;the murderer, and the
tyrant. Yes, king, I know to whom I
plead.</p>

him fast; see he escape not. Mohammed
stands not to be braved by a beardless boy!
Hence! [<i>Guards approach with chains.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Lay not hands upon me,&mdash;I am
no slave! One more appeal: May a son
look once more upon his father ere death<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;228]</span>
parts them forever? May I but for an
hour speak with Cleon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> Once more thou mayst look

[<i>He breaks the sword, and flings it down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moh'd.</span> Again dost thou brave me!
Away with the rebel! Bind him hand

Mohammed's slave. Hence, I say!</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Tent of</i> <span class="smcap">Zuleika</span>; <i>guitar, ottoman, etc.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Zuleika</span> [<i>pacing up and down</i>]. Night
draweth on apace, and ever nearer comes
the fatal hour. With to-morrow's dawn
all hope is o'er, for Mohammed hath sworn
the Greek shall die, and when was <i>he</i> ere
known to fail in his dread purpose? In
vain have I wept before him, imploring him
to have some mercy; in vain have I
sought with golden promises to move the
stony-hearted Hafiz,&mdash;all, all hath failed,
and I am in despair. And that brave
youth, his true heart filled with love's pure
devotion, seeking by the sacrifice of his
own life to save a father! And now each
moment bringeth nearer the death-hour of
that father, and he is mourning in solitude
that he may not say farewell. Where can
I turn for help? Ah, Hassan! my faithful
slave. He is true, and loveth me like his<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;231]</span>
own. He must aid me [<i>claps her hands</i>;
<i>enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hassan</span>]. Hassan, thou lovest me,
and would not see me grieve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Allah, forbid! Thou art dear
to old Hassan as the breath of life, and
while life lingers he will serve thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Then must thou aid me in a
deed of mercy. Who doth keep watch
to-night before the tent of the young Greek?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Mine is the watch. Wherefore
dost thou seek to know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Hassan, thou hast sworn to
serve me. I have a boon to ask of thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Speak, lady! thy slave doth
listen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Thou knowest that with the
morning sun Mohammed hath sworn Cleon
shall die. Such is the fierce anger he doth
bear his foe he hath refused all mercy and
scorned to listen to the prayers of the
young prince who hath journeyed hither at
peril of his own life to place himself in
the power of the king as hostage for
his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;232]</span>
<span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> It is indeed most true. Poor
youth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> 'Tis of him I would speak to
thee. Mohammed, angered at his boldness,
hath, as thou knowest, guarded him in
yonder tent, denying him his last sad
prayer to speak once more in life with
his father. Oh, Hassan, what must be the
agony of that young heart to see the hours
swift speeding by, and know no hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> What wouldst thou have me
do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Lead him to his father; give
him the consolation of folding to his breast
the beloved one to save whose life he hath
sacrificed his own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Dear mistress, thou art dreaming,
and cannot know the danger of so
rash a deed. Bethink thee of Mohammed's
anger, the almost certain doom of such as
dare to brave his mighty will. I pray thee
let not thy noble heart lead thee astray.
Thou canst not save him, and will but
harm thyself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;233]</span><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Hassan, thy love and true
devotion, I well know, doth prompt thee
to thus counsel, and in thy fear for me
thou dost forget to think of mercy or of
pity. I thank thee; but thou canst not
move me from my firm resolve. Again I
ask thee, Wilt thou aid me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan</span> [<i>falling at her feet</i>]. Pardon, but
I cannot. Heed, I implore thee, the counsel
of thy faithful servant, and trust to the
wisdom these gray hairs have brought.
Thou art young and brave, but believe
me, maiden, dangers of which thou dost
not dream beset the path, and I were no
true friend did I not warn thee to beware.
Do not tempt me; I cannot aid thee to
thy ruin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Then will I go alone. I will
brave the peril, and carry comfort to a
suffering soul [<i>turns to go</i>; <span class="smcap">Hassan</span> <i>catches
her robe</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Maiden! once more let thy
slave entreat. Thy father places faith in
me. I am the captive's guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;234]</span><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Peace, Hassan, peace; if life
be then so dear to thee, and thy duty to
thy king greater than that thou dost owe
to thy fellow-man, Allah forbid that I
should tempt thee to forget it. But did
death look me in the face, I would not
tarry now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> And thou wouldst seek the
captive's cell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> This very hour. Soon it will
be too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Thou knowest not the way,&mdash;soldiers
guard every turn. Oh, tarry
till the dawn, I do implore thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> The darkness shall be my
guide, Allah my guard; shrouded in yon
dark mantle none will deem me other than
a slave. Again I ask thee, Wilt thou go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> I go. I were no true man to
tremble when a woman fears not. I will
guide thee, and may Allah in his mercy
shield us both. Say thy prayers, Hassan,
for thy head no longer rests in safety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Come, let us on! The moments<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;235]</span>
speed. The darkening gloom befriends
us. First to the tent of the young
prince, and while I in brief speech do acquaint
him with mine errand, thou shalt
keep guard without. Then will we guide
him to his father, and unto Allah leave the
rest [<i>shrouds herself in dark mantle and veil</i>].
Lead on, good Hassan. Let us away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Fold thy veil closer, that
none may know the daughter of Mohammed
walks thus late abroad. Come,
and Allah grant we sleep not in paradise
to-morrow!</p>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Ion's</span> <i>tent</i>.
<span class="smcap">Ion</span> <i>chained, in an attitude of deep despair, upon
a miserable couch. He does not see the entrance
of</i> <span class="smcap">Zuleika</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hassan</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Zuleika.</span> Stand thou without as watch,
good Hassan, and warn me if any shall
approach. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hassan</span>.] Young Greek,
despair not; hope is nigh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion</span> [<i>starting up</i>]. Bright vision, whence
comest thou? Art thou the phantom of a
dream, or some blest visitant from that
better land, come to bear me hence?
What art thou?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> I am no vision, but a mortal
maiden, come to bring thee consolation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Consolation! ah, then indeed thou
art no mortal; for unto grief like mine
there is no consolation, save that which
cometh from above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;237]</span><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Nay, believe it not. Human
hearts are at this moment hoping, and
human hands are striving earnestly to
spare thee the agony thou dost dread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Are there then hearts to feel for
the poor Greek? I had thought I was
alone,&mdash;alone 'mid mine enemies. Sure,
those fetters are no dream, this dark
cell, the words "Thy father dies!" No,
no! it is a dread reality. The words are
burned into my brain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Is death, then, so dread a
thing unto a warrior? I had thought it
brought him fame and glory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Death! Oh, maiden! To the
soldier on the battle-field, fighting for his
father-land 'mid the clash of arms, the
fierce blows of foemen, the shouts of victory;
'neath the banner of his country,
the gratitude of a nation, the glory of a
hero round his brow,&mdash;death were a
happy, ay, a welcome friend. But alone,
'mid foes, disgraced by fetters, dragged to
a dishonored grave, with none to whisper<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;238]</span>
of hope or comfort, death is a cruel, a most
bitter foe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Mine errand is to take from
that death the bitterness thou dost mourn,
to give a parting joy to the life now
passing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Oh, hast thou the power to save
my father's life! Oh, use it now, and
Greece shall bless thee for thy mercy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Oh, that the power <i>were</i> mine,
how gladly would I use it in a cause so
glorious! I am but a woman, and tho' the
heart is strong, the arm is very weak. I
cannot save thy father, but trust I may
still cheer the parting hours with a brief
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Lady, thy words of kindly sympathy
fall like sweet music on my troubled
heart, and at thy magic call hope springeth
up anew. Thou art unknown, and yet
there is that within that doth whisper I
may trust thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Thou mayst indeed. Heaven
were not more true than I will be<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;239]</span>
unto my word. [<span class="smcap">Hassan</span> <i>pauses before the
door</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Lady, the hours are fleeting.
It were best to make good speed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Hassan, thou dost counsel
aright; morn must not find me here. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Ion</span>.] Young Greek, thou knowest with
the coming dawn thy father dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Ay, ere another moon doth rise
that life, so dear to Greece, shall be no
more; the heart that beat so nobly at his
country's call be still forever,&mdash;I know it
well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> And hast thou no last word
for him, no parting wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> O maiden, my life were a glad
sacrifice, so that I might for a single hour
look on him,&mdash;for the last time say, "My
father, bless thy Ion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> That hour shall be thine.
Fold thyself in yonder cloak, and follow
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Follow thee,&mdash;and whither?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> To thy father's presence.<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;240]</span>
Thou shalt spend with him the last hours
of his earthly life. Stay not; this friendly
gloom will ere long pass away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion</span> [<i>falling on his knees and catching her
robe</i>]. Art thou my guardian angel? Oh,
may the consolation thou hath poured into
a suffering soul, fall like heaven's dew
upon thine own; and if the prayers of a
grateful heart bring hope and joy and
peace, thy life shall bloom with choicest
blessings. O maiden, how do I bless
thee! [<i>Kisses her robe.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Speak not of that,&mdash;kneel
not to me, a mortal maiden. Thy gratitude
is my best reward. Hassan, lead
on!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> Lady, I do thy bidding. First
let me lead thee to a place of safety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Nay, Hassan, I tarry here,&mdash;thou
canst return; I will await thee. Now
make all speed,&mdash;away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Let us hence; my heart can ill
contain its joy. Oh, my father, shall I
see thee, hear thy voice, feel thine arms<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;241]</span>
once more about me, and die with thy
blessing on my head. Heaven hath blessed
my mission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Shall we depart? The hour
wanes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> I will follow whither thou shalt
lead. But, stay! is there no danger unto
thee? Will thy deed of mercy bring suffering
to thee, my kind deliverer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Fear not for me. Yet one
pledge must I ask of thee on which my
safety doth depend. 'Tis this: Swear
that from the moment thou dost leave me
until thou art again a prisoner here,
though the path lie plain before thee
thou wilt not fly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> I swear. Thou mayst trust me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Yet once again. Breathe not
to mortal ear the <i>means</i> by which thou
sought'st thy sire, and let the memory of
this hour fade from thy heart forever. [<span class="smcap">Ion</span>
<i>bows assent</i>.] What pledge have I of thy
secrecy, and of thy truth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> The word of a Greek is sacred,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;242]</span>
and were not my gratitude my surest
pledge to <i>thee</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Pardon, I do trust. Now
haste thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion</span> [<i>pointing to his fetters</i>]. Thou dost
forget I am a prisoner still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika.</span> Hassan, unloose these fetters,
and give the Greek his freedom. [<span class="smcap">Hassan</span>
<i>takes off the chains</i>; <span class="smcap">Ion</span> <i>springs joyfully
forward</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Now am I free again, and with
the Turk's base fetters have I cast off my
fears and my despair. Hope smiles upon
me, and my father calls. Oh, let us tarry
not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zuleika</span> [<i>folding a dark mantle round
him</i>]. Thus shrouded, in safety thou mayst
reach his cell; this ring will spare thee
question. Hassan will guide thee, and I&mdash;will

May Allah aid thee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Lady, though I may never know
thee, never look on thee again, the memory
of this brief hour will never fade.<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;243]</span>
The blessed gift of mercy thou dost bestow

Thou camest thither&mdash;how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Alone, with my good sword.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Thy guide through the perils
of the way, my child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> The good Father who doth guide
all who trust in him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> And thine errand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> To behold thee, my father, and
with my life to strive for thy release.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> My noble boy, thou hast come
unto thy death. Oh, who could bid thee
thus brave the doom that must await
thee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;246]</span><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> My mother bid me forth; and as
she girded on my sword, she bid me seek
my father, with her blessing on my
mission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> My brave Iantha, thus for thy
country's sake to doom thine own heart to
so deep a sorrow [<i>looks sadly upon</i> <span class="smcap">Ion</span>].
Tell me, my son, did thy mother bear
bravely up against the fatal tidings? I
had feared her tender heart might but ill
meet a blow so fearful. Speak to me of
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> When the rude Turk did in rough
speech acquaint her with thy fell defeat,
she sank as one o'erpowered by her grief,
praying the friendly hand of death might
take her hence; but soon the spirit of
the Greek rose high within her, and, banishing
her fears, with brave and trusting
heart she sent me forth to seek, and if it
might be, save thee. Ah, my father, that
I might die for thee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> And thou hath come to see me
die! Dost thou not know that with the<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;247]</span>
night thy father passeth hence, and when
the stars again look forth it will be upon
his grave?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Father, 'tis because thou art
doomed that I am here. And if my heart
speak truly, those same bright stars shall
serve to guide thee back to freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Thou doth speak wildly. What
wilt thou do? Wilt <i>thou</i> brave the king?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion</span> [<i>proudly</i>]. Nay, I have knelt for
the last time unto Mohammed. I have
offered him my liberty, my service, ay,
my life itself, and he hath scorned me. I
have deigned to bow before him as a suppliant,
and he hath spurned me; I have
sought by all the power love and despair
could teach to move him, and his ear was
closed to me. I seek him not again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Child, what hath led thee to the
presence of the king? How didst thou
brave the frown of him before whom even
<a name="armed" id="armed"><ins title="Original had arm√®d">armed</ins></a>
men do tremble? Didst thou dream
thy feeble voice could reach a heart so
cruel, that thy prayers could soften<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;248]</span>
one who knoweth not the name of
mercy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Love can brave all dangers. It
giveth wisdom to the untaught, strength
to the weak, hope to the despairing, comfort
to the mourner. Love hath been my
guide, my guard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> My boy! my Ion! Truly
doth God place in the pure heart of such
as thou his truest wisdom, his deepest faith
[<i>embraces him with deep emotion</i>]. But&mdash;art
not thou in danger? Did not thy bold
speech anger the proud king? Art thou
still free?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Let not thy heart be vexed with
fears for me,&mdash;I am unharmed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Ion, deceive me not, but as
thou hopest for thy father's love, speak
truly. Art thou in danger from the Turk,
and in thy devotion to thy father dost
thou seek to be thyself the sacrifice?
Answer me, Ion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Father, I sought to spare thy too
o'erburdened heart another grief. I <i>am</i> a<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;249]</span>
prisoner in Mohammed's power, and know
not if my fate be life or death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> 'Tis as I feared; and thou, the
last hope of thy country, must fall,&mdash;all,
all, for me! Oh, mine own disgrace were
bitter, but to see thee die! Oh, woe
is me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Father, were it not better thus to
die, than in disgraceful peace to pass away
with no thought for our fatherland, no
proud consciousness of having at the call
of duty sacrificed all we held most dear,
and leave a name held sacred as one who
yielded life and liberty on the altar of his
country?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> But that thou in thine innocence
and bloom should meet death at the
hands of heartless foemen; and for <i>my</i>
sake! 'Tis this that tears my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> The purer the victim the more
acceptable the sacrifice. But fear not,
dear father. The Turk is yet a man;
'tis 'gainst thee he wars, and he will not
wreak his vengeance on a child. He may<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;250]</span>
relent, and for my love's sake, pardon
mine offence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Child, thou knowest not Mohammed.
He pardons none; all fall before
him, with relentless hand,&mdash;all strew
his pathway unto victory. Will he then
spare and pity thee? Nay, sire and son
must fall! [<i>Stands sorrowfully.</i> <span class="smcap">Ion</span> <i>suddenly
sees</i> <span class="smcap">Zuleika's</span> <i>ring upon his hand, and
springs forward</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Father, thou shalt yet breathe the
air of freedom, shall clasp my mother
to thy heart; once more shall lead thy
gallant band onward to victory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Raise not bright hopes to crush
them at their birth; wake not to dreams
of triumph the heart that hath striven to
drive hence all save the solemn thoughts
meet for one so soon to pass away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion</span> [<i>pointing to the door</i>]. See, the gray
morning 'gins to glimmer in the east.
'Tis no time for despair. Haste, Father,
freedom is near!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> What doth thus move thee,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;251]</span>
Ion? Dost thou forget these chains, the
guards, the perils at each step? Thou art
dreaming!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> I tell thee 'tis no dream. Thou
shalt be free. This mantle will disguise
thee; this ring open a pathway through
the guards; these stars shall be thy silent
guide. Wilt thou go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> 'Tis strange! Whence then
that ring? How dost thou, a captive,
wander thus freely, and offer liberty with
such a bounteous hand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> A solemn oath doth forbid me to
reveal to living man the secret of this
hour; but if ever angels do leave their
homes to minister to suffering souls, 'twas
one most bright and beautiful who hath
this night led me unto thee, and placed in
mine hand the power to set thee free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Truth speaketh in thine earnest
eye and pleading voice, and yet I
dare not listen to thy tale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Oh, Father, heed not thy fears,
thy doubts! Take thy liberty, believing it<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;252]</span>
heaven-sent. No oath binds thee to Mohammed;
thou art no rightful prisoner of
war,&mdash;neither duty nor honor doth demand
thy stay. Thy country calls, and
Heaven doth point the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> 'Tis true; no oath doth bind
me to the Turk, and yet to fly&mdash;My
soldier's spirit doth ill brook such
retreat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Then stay not, my father, but
whilst thou may, depart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Bright hopes call me hence.
Life, love, fame, beckon me away.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Hassan</span> <i>looks in</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> The promised hour hath well-nigh
gone. Prepare, young Greek; we

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> A moment more. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hassan</span>.]
Father, time wanes. Once more I do
entreat thee,&mdash;go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Heaven grant I choose aright!
Come Ion, we will forth together. [<span class="smcap">Ion</span>
<i>folds the cloak about</i> <span class="smcap">Cleon</span>; <i>gives him the

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;253]</span><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Nay, but one can pass forth.
Thou goest. I await the morning here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Then do I tarry also. Nay,
Ion, I will not go hence without thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Then all is lost. Father, thy stay
can nought avail me. It cannot save, and
thou wilt but sacrifice thine own priceless
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Then fly with me; let me bear
thee to thy mother. Alone, I will not
go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> I cannot go; a vow doth bid me
stay,&mdash;a vow that nought shall tempt me
from the camp to-night; and when did a
Greek e'er break his plighted word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> If thine honor bid thee stay, thy
father will not tempt thee hence; but he
may stay and suffer with thee the fate of
the faithful [<i>throws off the mantle</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> Oh, my father, do not cast from
thee the priceless boon of liberty. Think
of thy broken-hearted wife, thy faithful
followers, thy unconquered foes; think,
Father, of thy country calling on thee for<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;254]</span>
deliverance. What were my worthless life
weighed 'gainst her freedom. And what
happier fate for a hero's son than for a
hero's sake to fall!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> Thou true son of Greece!
Mayst thou yet live to wield a sword for
thine oppressed land, and gird with laurels
that brow so worthy them.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Hassan</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan.</span> No longer may I stay: thine
hour is past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion.</span> I come,&mdash;yet one moment more,
good Hassan; it is my last. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hassan</span>.]
Once more, my father, do I entreat thee,&mdash;go.
Thou dost forget a guardian spirit
watcheth over me, and the power that led
me hither may yet accomplish my deliverance.
If nought else can move thee, for
my sake go, and win for me that freedom
mine honor doth now forbid me to seek.
Break not my heart, nor let me plead in

<p><span class="smcap">Cleon.</span> My boy, for thy dear sake do
I consent. I <i>will</i> earn thy deliverance<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;255]</span>
bravely, as a soldier should; and thy dear
image shall be to me the star that leads
me on to victory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ion</span> [<i>joyfully</i>]. Away! Hassan will

<p><span class="smcap">
Nina.</span> 'Tis a fair and lovely home and
well befits a gay young bride; but ah, not
if she bear a sad and weary heart like mine
beneath her bridal robes. All smile on me
and call me happy, blessed with such a
home and husband; and yet 'mid all my
splendor I could envy the poor cottage
maiden at her spinning-wheel. For ah,
'mid all her poverty one sweet thought
comes ever like a sunny sky to brighten
e'en her darkest hours, for she is loved;
while I yet sigh in vain for one kind word,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;280]</span>
one tender glance, from him I love so
fondly. Ah, he comes, no sad tears now,
sorrow is for my lonely hours and I will
smile on <i>him</i> e'en though my heart is
breaking.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Count Adrian</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian</span> [<i>coldly</i>]. Good-even, madam, I
trust all things are placed befitting a fair
lady's bower and thou hast found thy home
a pleasant one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Adrian, husband, speak not thus
to me. I could find more joy in some poor
cell with thee, than all the wealth that
kings could give if thou wert gone. Look
kindly on me and I ask no more. One
smile from thee can brighten all the world
to these fond eyes. Oh, turn not away,
but tell me how have I angered thee, and
grant thy pardon for thy young wife's first
offence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> The pardon I could give were
worthless for the time is past. 'Tis too
late to ask forgiveness now. It matters
not, then say no more [<i>turns away</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;281]</span><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> My lord, I charge thee tell me
of what dark crime thou dost think me
guilty! Fear not to tell me; innocence
is strong to bear and happy to forgive.
Ah, leave me not, I cannot rest till I know
all, and if the deep devotion of a woman's
heart can still repair the wrong, it shall be
thine&mdash;but answer me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Canst thou unsay the solemn
words that bound us at the altar three
short days ago? Canst thou give back the
freedom thou hast taken, break the vows
thou hast plighted, cast away that ring and
tell me I am free? Do it, and my full forgiveness
shall be thine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Give thee back thy freedom;
am I a chain to bind thee to what thou
dost not love? Take back the vows I
made to honor thee; what dost thou mean?
I am thy wife and dost thou hate me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> God help me now. Tell me,
Adrian, I implore thee, tell me what have
I done to tempt such cruel words from<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;282]</span>
thee? I loved thee and left all to be thy
wife, and now when my poor heart is longing
for one tender word to cheer its sorrow,
thou, the husband who hath vowed to love
and cherish me, hath said thou dost hate
me. Ah, am I sleeping? Wake me or the
dream will drive me mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> 'Tis a dream I cannot banish.
We must part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Part&mdash;go on, the blow hath
fallen, I can feel no more. Go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Thou knowest I wooed thee.
Thou wert fair and wondrous rich; I sought
thy gold, not <i>thee</i>, for with thy wealth I
would carve out a path through life that
all should honor. Well, we were wed, and
when I sought to take thy fortune it was
gone, and not to me, but to thy father's
friend, Don Felix. It was all left to him,
and thou wert penniless; and thus I won a
wife I loved not, and lost the gold I would
have died to gain. Thinkest thou not I am
well angered? But for thee I might yet
win a noble bride whose golden fetters I
would gladly wear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;283]</span>
<span class="smcap">Nina.</span> And this is he to whom I gave
my heart so filled with boundless love and
trust. Oh, Adrian, art thou so false? What
is gold to a woman's deathless love? Can
it buy thee peace and all the holy feelings
human hearts can give? Can it cheer and
comfort thee in sorrow, or weep fond, happy
tears when thou hast won the joy and
honor thou dost seek? No, none of these,
the golden chains will bind thee fast till no
sweet thought, no tender hope can come
to thee. I plead not now for my poor self,
but for thine own heart thou doth wrong
so cruelly by such vain dreams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Enough. Thou hast a noble
name and men will honor thee, thou wilt
suffer neither pain nor want. I will leave
thee and wander forth to seek mine own
sad lot. Farewell, and when they ask thee
for thy husband, tell them thou hast none,
and so be happy [<i>turns to go</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Oh, Adrian, I implore thee stay.
I will bear all thy coldness, ay even thy
contempt. I will toil for thee and seek to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;284]</span>
win the gold for which thou dost sigh, I
will serve thee well and truly, for with all
my heart I love thee still. Leave me not
now or I shall die! [<i>Kneels and clasps his
hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> I am a slave till death shall
set me free. We shall not meet again.
Nay, kneel not to me. I do forgive thee,
but I cannot love thee [<i>rushes out</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> This is more than I can bear.
Oh, Father, take thy poor child home, and
still the sorrow of this broken heart.</p>

Hagar.</span> What brings thee hither, gentle

high-born and the fair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. There is often deeper
sorrow in the palace than the cot, good
Hagar, and I seek thee for some counsel
that will cure the pain of a lonely heart.
I have tried all others' skill in vain, and
come to thee so learned in mystic lore to
give me help. I am rich and can repay
thee well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hagar.</span> I can read a sad tale in thy
pale and gentle face, dear lady. Thou art
young and loving, but the hope of youth is
gone; and thou art sorrowing with no fond
heart whereon to lean, no tender voice to
comfort and to cheer. Ah, have I read<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;286]</span>
aright? Then the only charm to still thy
pain is death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> 'Tis death I long for. That still,
dreamless sleep would bring me peace.
But 'tis a fearful thing to take the life
God gave, and I dare not. Canst thou not
give me help?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hagar.</span> Within this tiny casket there
is that which brings a quiet sleep filled
with happy dreams, and they who drink
the draught lie down and slumber, and if
not awakened it will end in death. But
thou, sweet lady, wouldst not leave this fair
world yet. Tell me more, for this old
heart is warm and tender still, and perchance
I can help thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> 'Tis strange that I can feel such
faith in thee, kind friend, but I am young
and lonely and I seek some heart for counsel.
Thou art from my own fair land and
I will tell thee of my sorrow. 'Tis a short,
sad tale. I loved, was wed, and then&mdash;oh,
darksome day&mdash;I learned my husband felt
no love, and sought me only for my gold.<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;287]</span>
I was penniless, and thus he cast me off; and
now for long, long weeks I have not seen
him, for he would not dwell with her who
loved him more than life itself. Now give
me some sweet charm to win that lost heart
back. Ah, Hagar, help me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hagar.</span> I can give thee no truer charm
than that fair face and noble soul, dear
lady. Be thou but firm and faithful in thy
love and it will win thy husband back.
God bless and grant all happiness to one
who doth so truly need it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Give me the casket; and when
life hath grown too bitter to be borne then
will I gladly lay the burden down, and
blessing him I love so well sleep that calm
slumber that knows no awaking. Farewell,
Hagar, thou hast given me comfort and I
thank thee.</p>

can find no rest save here; and thus do I
seek my home, worn out by my long wandering,
and trusting to learn tidings of poor
Nina. If she be true and love me still I
will cast away my pride, my coldness, and
all vain hopes of wealth, and let the sunlight
of that pure, young life brighten my
life henceforth. I hear a step, and will
hide here, perchance I may thus see her
[<i>hides behind curtain</i>].</p>

whispering that dear name, ever sorrowing<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;289]</span>
for those hard words that gave so deep a
wound. All is dark and lonely, for he is
gone. Only these withered flowers, dearer
by far than my most costly gems, for his
hand hath touched them, and he smiled on
me when they were given. Oh, Adrian,
wilt thou never give one tender thought
to her who still loves and prays for thee?
Death will soon free thee from thy hated
wife.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Nina</span>.</p>

cold eyes smile kindly on me here, and the
lips seem speaking tender words. Other<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;290]</span>
faces are perchance more fair, but none so
dear to me. Oh, husband, thou hast cast
me off; and yet, though lonely and forsaken,
I still can cherish loving thoughts of thee,
and round thy image gather all the tender
feelings that a woman's heart can know.
Thy cruel words I can forgive, and the
trusting love I gave thee glows as warmly
now as when thou didst cast it by and left
me broken-hearted [<i>weeps</i>; <i>enter</i> <span class="smcap">Don
Felix</span>]. My lord, what seekest thou with
me? Thou dost smile. Ah, hast thou
tidings of my husband? Tell me quickly,
I beseech thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> Nay, dear lady&mdash;But sit
thee down and let me tell thee why I came.
[<i>He leads her to a sofa.</i>] Thou knowest I
have been with thee from a child. I stood
beside thee at the altar, and was the first to
cheer and comfort thee when thou wast
left deserted and alone. Let me now ask
thee, Wouldst thou not gladly change thy
sad lot here for a gay and joyous life with
one who loves thee fondly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;291]</span>
<span class="smcap">Nina.</span> It were indeed a happy lot to be
so loved and cherished; but where, alas, is
he who could thus feel for one so lonely
and forsaken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix</span> [<i>kneeling</i>]. Here at thy feet,
dear Nina. Nay, do not turn away, but
let me tell thee of the love that hath
grown within my heart. [<i>Nina starts up.</i>]
Thy wedded lord hath cast thee off. The
law can free thee. Ah, then be mine, and
let me win and wear the lovely flower
which he hath cast away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Lord Felix, as the wife of him
thou dost so wrong, I answer thee. Dost
thou not know the more a woman's heart
is crushed and wounded the more tenderly
it clings where first it loved; and though
deserted, ay, though hated, I had rather
be the slighted wife of him, than the honored
bride of the false Costella. Now
leave me&mdash;I would be alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> A time will come, proud
woman, when thou shalt bend the knee to
him whom now thou dost so scorn. Beware,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;292]</span>
for I will have a fierce revenge for
the proud words thou hast spoken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> I am strong in mine own heart
and fear thee not. Work thy will and thou
shalt find the wife of Adrian de Mortemar
needs no protector save her own fearless
hand.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Nina</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> Now, by my faith, thou
shalt bow that haughty head, and sue to
me for mercy, and I will deny it. I'll
win her yet, she shall not idly brave my
anger. Now to my work,&mdash;revenge.</p>

Nina.</span> Ever thus alone, mourning for

but return even for one short hour to thy
poor Nina. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Adrian</span>, <i>disguised</i>.] Ha,
who art thou that dares to enter here in
such mysterious guise? Thine errand,
quickly,&mdash;speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> Forgive me, lady, if I cause
thee fear; I would have thee know me as a
friend, one who will watch above thee, and
seek to spare thee every sorrow. Dear
lady, think me not too bold, for I have
known thee long and have a right to all
thy confidence. Thy husband was my
nearest friend; and, when he left thee
friendless and alone, I vowed to guard and<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;294]</span>
save thee in all peril. Wilt thou trust
me? See, I bear his ring,&mdash;thou knowest
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> 'Tis indeed his ring. Whence
came it? Ah, hast thou seen him? Tell
me, and I will give thee all my confidence
and thanks [<i>takes the ring and gazes beseechingly
upon</i> <span class="smcap">Adrian</span>, <i>who turns aside</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span> He is well, lady, and happy as
one can be who bears a cold, proud heart
within his breast. He has cast away an
angel who could have cheered and blessed
his life, and sought to find in gold the happiness
thy love alone could bring. He has
suffered, as he well deserves to do. Spend
not thy pity upon him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina</span> [<i>proudly</i>]. And who art thou to
speak thus of him? Thou canst not judge
till thou also hast been tried and like him
deceived. He sought for wealth to bring
him fame and honor; and when he found
it not, what wonder that he cast aside the
love that could not bring him happiness.
Thou art no true friend to speak thus of<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;295]</span>
one so worthy to be loved. And think not
I reproach him for my lonely lot. Ah, no,
I still love on; and if he wins the wealth he
covets I can give my heart's best blessing,
and so pass away that he shall never know
whose hand hath crushed the flower that
would have clung about his life and shed
its perfume there [<i>turns away weeping</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian</span> [<i>aside</i>]. She loves me still. I'll

cheered thy solitude and won thy heart.
I fain would ask thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Sir stranger, little dost thou
know a woman's heart. I have found
a comfort for my lonely hours in weeping
o'er the face whose smiles could brighten
life for me, or dim it by disdain and coldness.
The face is there; my first, last,
only love is given to him who thinks it
worthless and hath cast it by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Thou canst not tempt me to
forget. No other love can win me from
the only one who hath a place within my
heart. Let me cherish all the memories of
him, and till life shall cease be true unto
my husband. Now leave me, unknown
friend; I trust thee for his sake, and will
accept thy friendship and protection. I
offer thee my gratitude and thanks for thy
kind service, and will gladly seek how best
I may repay it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Nina.</span> I tell thee, my lord, I will not
listen, naught thou canst say will change
my firm resolve. I cannot wed thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> Nay, then listen. Thy
cruel husband left thee and for one long

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Do I dream, my husband here

'Tis a false tale to anger me. I heed thee
not [<i>turns away haughtily</i>].<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;299]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> Thou wilt heed me ere I
am done. What thinkest thou of this thy
husband's dagger? See, here his name.
'Twas taken from his hands ere the cold
chains bound them. Ah, thou dost believe
me now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Oh, tell on. I <i>will</i> listen now.
Why hast thou done this cruel deed? Why
make this his welcome home? Thou hast
fettered and imprisoned him and now art
here to tell me of it? Ah, dost thou hate
him? Then give all thy hate to me; but
oh, I pray thee, comfort him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> When thou didst reject my
suit, I told thee I would be revenged; I said
a day would come when thou, so cold and
haughty then, would kneel to me imploring
mercy and I would deny thee. That
time hath come, and I am deaf to all thy
prayers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> For his sake will I kneel to thee
beseeching liberty for <i>him</i>. I had no love
to give thee. Ah, pardon if I spake with
scorn, and pity me. What can I do to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;300]</span>
win thee back to mercy? Ah, listen and
be generous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> 'Tis now too late. He is
in my power; and a dagger can soon rid
thee of a cruel husband, me of a hated rival.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> God have pity on me now. Don
Felix, let me plead once more. Set Adrian
free, and I will take his place in yon dark
cell and welcome there the dagger that
shall set me free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> And wilt <i>thou</i> wear the

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Ay, gladly will I suffer pain, captivity,
and death, for thee, Adrian, for thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> Then woman's love is
stronger than man's hate, and I envy him
you would die for, Nina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Ah, love alone can make home
blest, and here it dwells not. I can free
him from his fetters and his hated wife.
Tell him I loved him to the last, and
blessed him ere I died. Lead on, my lord,
I am ready.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>A cell in the palace of</i> <span class="smcap">Don Felix</span>.
<span class="smcap">Nina</span> <i>chained</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Nina.</span> 'T is strange; here in this dark
cell, tho' fettered and alone, I feel a deeper
joy than when a proud and envied bride
I dwelt in my deserted home. For here
his foot hath trod; these walls have echoed
to the voice I love; these chains so cold
and heavy I more gladly wear than e'en
the costly gems once clasped upon these
arms, for they were his. Here his sad
tears fell perchance for his captivity; but I
can smile and bless the hour when I could
win thy freedom, Adrian, with my poor
liberty. Hark&mdash;they come. Is it to claim
the vow I made to yield my bosom to the
dagger meant for his? I am ready.
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Don Felix</span>.] Alone, my lord; methought
it were too sad a task for thee to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;304]</span>
take my life. Well, be it so; you claim
my vow. I can die still blessing thee, my
Adrian [<i>kneels before</i> <span class="smcap">Don Felix</span>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> Rise, Nina; ah, kneel not
to me, nor think this hand could take the
life it prizes more than happiness or honor.
I came not here to harm thee; Heaven
forbid! I came once more to offer thee
my heart, my home, and all the boundless
love you have so scorned. Thy husband
hath deserted thee; no ties too fast to sever
bind thee to him. Thou art alone, a captive,
and I alone can free thee. Think of
the love I bear thee, Nina, and be mine
[<i>takes her hand</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Where is thy boasted honor
now? Where the solemn vow thou didst
make me that my lonely cell should be as
sacred to thee as my palace halls? Where
is thy pity for the helpless wife of him
whom thou didst call thy friend? I never
loved thee, now I scorn thee. A true and
pure affection never binds such chains as
these, nor causes bitter tears like mine to<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;305]</span>
flow. Rather suffer death than cherish in
my heart one tender thought of thee.
Thou hast my answer, now leave me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> Not yet, proud captive. I
have sought to win thee gently; but now,
beware. Think not to escape me, thou
shalt feel how deep a vengeance I can
bring on thee and him thou lovest. Thou
shalt suffer all the sorrow I can inflict,&mdash;shalt
know thy proud lord forsaken and in
danger when a word from me can save,
and <i>that</i> word I will not speak. All the
grief and pain and hatred that my jealous
heart can give will I heap upon his head,
and thus through him I will revenge myself
on thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Thou canst not harm him, he is
safe and free. Do thy worst, I care not
what fate thou hast for me, a fearless hand
soon finds a way to free a soul from sorrow
and captivity. This heart thou canst not
reach. It fears thee not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Felix.</span> Can I not make thee
tremble, haughty woman? I love thee still,<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;306]</span>
and I will win thee. I go to work thee sorrow;
and when next we meet I will bring
thee token of thy husband's death or, what
may touch thee nearer, his hate of thee.</p>

tidings do I bring, but a wondrous tale of
happiness in store for thee. When thy
father died, few doubted but his wealth
would come to thee; and it would, indeed,
have all been thine had not that false Don
Felix stolen the will away. He took the
paper that left all to thee, and thus he won
the orphan's gold. But three short days
ago, a dreadful crime which he had done
was brought to light, and he hath fled. He
told me all and bid me give thee, this,
thy father's will. [<span class="smcap">Hagar</span> <i>gives paper to</i>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;309]</span><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> 'Tis strange, most strange. But

<p><span class="smcap">Hagar.</span> I knew him when he came
from Italy with thee and thy father years
ago. And as I watched thy path through
life so I watched his, and thus he learned
to trust me. 'Tis thus I gained for thee
that wealth so long withheld; and now my
work is done. Thou wilt win thy husband's
love, and so be happy. God bless
thee, gentle lady, and farewell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nina.</span> Ah, stay and tell me how can I
best show the gratitude I deeply feel.
Thou hast brought me wealth and happiness,
how can I repay thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hagar.</span> I ask no other joy than that
I see in thy fair face. I go now to my
own dear land, and we shall not meet
again; but old Hagar will remember thee,

love, then why live on to dim his pathway.
I will leave my gold to him, for it is<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;311]</span>
worthless now; and when, with her he loves
in some fair home, he sends perchance one
thought of her who died to free him, I shall
be repaid for this last sacrifice. Ah, Hagar,
little didst thou think the joy foretold
would end so soon, and this thy gift would
win for me the rest I long for now [<i>takes

me, I will send one last word, Adrian, to
thee. [<i>She writes, then sinks upon the couch.</i>]

could only die for thee. Farewell life, farewell

thee; but I could not. Thy dear face shone
in all my dreams, and thy voice still lingered
in mine ear, imploring me to love
thee. Then I returned to find thee drooping
like a blighted flower. All loved and<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;317]</span>
honored thee; and I vowed to watch, and, if
I found thee true and loving still, to tell
thee all, and give my heart to thee forever.
I have now won thee, and I love thee,
